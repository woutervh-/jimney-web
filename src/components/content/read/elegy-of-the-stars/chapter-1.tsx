            <p></p>

            <p>Thirteen years
            ago she was born and they created a star; a binary star system in the center of
            Oblivion, the sole city on the planet Glast, the place of her birth and dreary
            existence. They called it Seirios. The Scorcher. A bit like her own name, Oria,
            which meant bright and burning in the language of Glast. Seirios destroyed the
            world as they knew it. Its genesis – also called the Cataclysm – collapsed
            laboratory of the time and pulverized most of the city into white-hot debris.
But still, an achievement was an achievement.</p>

            <p>Oria clutched
            the frayed colourful scarf tighter around her thin neck and suppressed a snort
            as she averted her eyes from the stars where they gleamed from the shrine atop
            the Hall of Harvest. She would have been more impressed if what was left of the
            Administrative Council came up with a way to feed those who starved and froze
            to death next to her in the dusty alleys and derelict buildings of Oblivion.
            Heber had told her the Consortium of Science's power was reduced now that they
            had been decimated, most, if not all, of its members... changed by the
radiation.</p>

            <p>Heber was an
            idiot. He sat at home all day with his radiation-sick sister and knew nothing
            about the real world beyond his science and math and all the other useless
things he tried to teach her when she visited.</p>

            <p>Why would he
            even think she wanted to know she was thirteen human years old? That Glast
            rotated around a sun so far away one human year stretched to 500 Glast days?
            How the Seirios cult operated? What the cultivators had done to the scientists
to drag them down into the hole they were in now? What did it <i>matter</i>
                when she was trying not to starve or freeze to death every other day?</p>

            <p>And it wasn't
even winter yet.</p>

            <p>Her teeth
            clattered at the thought, but it might also have been the chill wind ghosting
            through the alley. How was she going to survive the cold season with its ice
            storms and perpetual darkness this year? She thought of Heber's house, and how
            warm it must be inside even without the expensive heaters dotted around the
            market. But he couldn't take her in because of his sister and she didn't want
            to stay with him anyway. It would mean more mouths to feed and Oria barely
managed to feed her own.</p>

            <p>She crouched to
            check whether her treadbare moccasins were hidden by the hem of her trousers.
            Her toes when she peeled away the soles were purplish-blue with the cold. She
            had to be careful if she didn't want to lose one of them – perhaps swipe a
            scrap of leather somewhere to close the holes before winter arrived. Still. To
            the west a scattering of suns too distant to provide much warmth or light was
            rising and they would do for now. They would have to – or she would be weak
again tomorrow. Her stomach grumbled. It had been doing that for a while.</p>

            <p>Oria let the
            soles go, and they popped back against the rim with a weak crack. Her hands
            went up to her dark hair and she gathered it into the balloon cap Heber had
            given her when she asked if he had anything less conspicuous than the dress he
            tried to deal her the last time. She dropped the filthy blanket that hadn't
            been washed since she swiped it from the clothes line from her shoulders and
            stood. The wind increased. Her nose seemed to blister with the cold as she made
her way down the alley to its mouth.</p>

            <p>Still.</p>

            <p>It couldn't be
            helped. She hadn't eaten anything solid in two and a half days and nobody could
            survive on a sip of water muddied with rat excrement and pieces of mouldy bread
somebody else already half chewed and then spit out alone.</p>

            <p>She drew the
            hat deeper into her face as she exited the alley's south end and the glow of
            Seirios increased. The Hall of Harvest was still a few minutes walk, and the
            distance felt like a trip to Earth with her empty belly and all, but bare feet
            unprotected from the wood-and-glass splinter strewn ground, but the artificial
star bathed the city itself into a beautiful light.</p>

            <p>It was easier
            to be a boy on the street. Nobody looked twice at a farmhand on their way back
            to the master they served, but they would want to take advantage of a lonely
            girl. Not that she was a solitary case in the city, an abandoned girl looking
            for food and shelter, but if Heber had taught her anything useful at all, then
            it was that men didn't care whether there were other girls just as vulnerable
            as she when they found her first. Of course, she hadn't know what that meant at
            the time, but several long years on the street had wisened her. Which was the
            reason she now carried a knife whereever she went. Which also was the reason
            she was glad to have a chest as flat as any boy's, on contrary to the older
girls she sometimes met.</p>

            <p>She ignored the
            guards' stares as she approached the Hall of Harvest. Today she was an acolyte
            of the Seirios – the child of the Administrator or one of the other cultivators
            – out to attend her first (or second) convergence with the adults. It was best
            she pretended to belong even if she didn't. The guards wore uniforms and
            weapons. They were initiates into the official ranks. The ones who still had to
            prove themselves to the Administrator and his staff. At least that was what
Heber said.</p>

            <p>Her pulse
            quickened as she came to the gates. Would they let her through? Was it usual for
            children to arrive early at the festival market without their parents? She
            wouldn't know. She didn't have any parents nor did she care to. The only person
            closest to a father was Heber, and Heber would have reproached her if he knew
about this plan.</p>

            <p>And yet.</p>

            <p>How else was
            she going to survive? He couldn't feed another mouth. He had it hard enough
            with his sick sister and even if he would have let her stay with him she could
fend for herself. It was difficult enough to feed one person.</p>

            <p>Then she was
through.</p>

            <p>The Hall of
            Harvest itself was the size of one of the giant spaceships that made the trip
            to distant Earth every once in a while and would do so again after winter
            started. Once filled with wealthy scholars and scientists, or so she had been
            told, the only people who were able to afford the market nowadays were the
            farmers and asteroid miners themselves. The ceiling crisscrossed with
            intricately carved light-pipes that transported the Seirios's illumination to
            the distant fields on the other side of the planet and made the cultivators
richer every day.</p>

            <p>The market
            itself was a coagulation of carts and stalls with wide displays of food almost
            nobody could afford, situated in the heart of Oblivion's least destroyed
            district. Oria strolled along the aisles casually, dark hair tucked away into
            her hat, gaze cast down though there was nothing to see underfoot, but sand and
            dirt. It hadn't taken long for her to learn that it was best to appear as if
you belonged even if you didn't.</p>

            <p>She found her
            target relatively quickly. A stand half concealed between two others, whose
            owner sold fruit, like apples and pears and grapes, and that Seirios-mutated
            fruit called starfruit, which supposedly tasted like sweet sugary heaven, and
            which she had never had and could never afford. The symbol of the
            Administrative Council was painted on the wooden frame of his stand. Another
Cataclysm-richened cultivator.</p>

            <p>In the
            Cataclysm science had died and cultivation became important. Until the Seirios
            exploded there had been a different equilibrium. There was almost the
            Administration of Glast above all else, and then there had been the scientists.
            Those like Heber, who went outside once or twice a year to see how their
            science influenced the world. But now, there were the cultivators, almost on
            top of the food chain. Almost more important than the Administration on paper,
            and much more important than the Administration in practice. They were the ones
            who harnesses the Seirios's energy to cultivate food. They farmed vegetables
            and fruit and made bread with grain and they monopolized their trade on Glast.
            A couple of years ago they managed to shut down most food transfers from
            distant Earth and other planets, too, and therefore reigned supreme on the
            small lightless planet. Who needed science when people were starving and only
wanted food?</p>

            <p>The cultivator
            she'd made her target was fat and bald. Most of them were fat. Two apples less
            wouldn't hurt that one's wallet, but that didn't mean he was going to give them
up for free.</p>

            <p>Oria picked her
            way closer, always staying hidden inside the shade cast by the surrounding
            ruins, her gaze darting around for guards or cultists. It was a gamble and the
            wager was her life. If she was caught by the city watch she would be whipped
and beheaded on the public spot to set an example.</p>

            <p>But she
            wouldn't be caught. The farmers lived in abundance and didn't pay enough
            attention to the paupers who starved in droves just around their corners. On
            top of that she was fast, faster than anybody she knew, and she knew a fair few
            fast rats around these perimeters, most of who couldn't be trusted, the rest
            crippled or blind from the Cataclysm and in much more need than even herself.
            That was why her next stop would be the deformed old man close to the Seirios
            Cult's headquarters. Though she could hardly afford it, she had allowed him to
rely on her.</p>

            <p>And then maybe
            she would check on useless Heber, see if he hadn't died of idiocy yet, or his
            mutated sister hadn't gone insane, as many of the mutation victims did, and
murdered him in his sleep.</p>

            <p>But that was
after.</p>

            <p>Oria slowed her
            steps as she approached her target's stand. She had already caught sight of her
            quarry, two apples at the lowest edge of the layered display, one of them
            wizened and the sickly pale colour of diseased skin, nothing the high society
            would want to buy anyway, the other round and red as her cheeks would have been
            had she been one of the councilmen's children, and was scouring the lavish
display for anything else she could take.</p>

            <p>A scrap of
            leather to wrap around her shoes so the soles would last another day? A morsel
            of bread to go with the apples? Maybe even an egg from that basket a little
            higher up? But that would be too risky. The apples were already uncertain
            enough although she could swipe those without raising her arms,
            inconspicuously, and be gone before the farmer noticed they were missing, which
she doubted he ever would in any case.</p>

            <p>Oria reached
            the stall. There was a basket of turnips on the other end from which she could
            grab a handful when she left, but for the moment her attention was focused
            solely on appearing as if she belonged, and that included wearing an impassive
            and impertinently unconcerned expression and not staring at the goods even
though their delicious scent was enough to drive her mad with hunger.</p>

            <p>Quick as an
            arrow she snatched the two apples without halting her pace, just as she had
            planned, just as she had done several times before, ambling along casually,
            without so much as a tiny skip in her step, and stowed them inside her shirt.
            The process was so familiar by now that her heart didn't even speed as it had
the first few thefts. Then it was time for the turnips.</p>

            <p>She was small
            enough she wouldn't have to bend to reach the basket. It would do to stretch
            out her left hand, snatch a turnip, and then proceed leisurely back to the end
            of the market from which she had come, where she could begin to sprint back to
her sheltered alley and examine her loot.</p>

            <p>She hadn't
taken so much as a step forward when a hand grabbed her from behind.</p>

            <p>“Who are you?”
snarled a rough voice in her ear.</p>

            <p>“Nothing!” Oria
struggled against the man's hold on her collar. “I didn't take nothing!”</p>

            <p>The man
hesitated. “What are you talking –“</p>

            <p>Oria's pulse
spiked in her ears. How stupid! She was an acolyte today. Not a street rat!</p>

            <p>“I didn't! I
didn't do it!”</p>

            <p>How could this
            have happened? One quick look around told her what she should have seen from
            the beginning: the stall next to the farmer's who currently held her by the
            neck was empty. The fat merchant behind the display was the neighbour, only
            watching the goods while the owner was away, and the actual owner had now
            returned. It was the mistake of a beginner to make, and her capture angered her
mostly because she was an expert scavenger.</p>

            <p>The farmer
            began to shake her so wildly the apples that had been pinned between her waist
an elbow dislodged and tumbled down into the dirt.</p>

            <p>“Hah!” he spat
            into her ear. “You little piece of filth! Didn't steal anything, did you?! Look
            at that? Where did you get those clothes? Who did you kill?” He shook her again
so that her teeth rattled against each other.</p>

            <p>A crowd was
already building.</p>

            <p>She had to get
            out of there before they called the guards on her and she ended up in the
            stocks. Food wasn't as important as staying alive, and though both prospects
looked equally x at the moment, she wasn't about to give up without a fight.</p>

            <p>Oria struggled
            wildly against his grip, swaying her thin legs with all the force she could
            muster, in the hopes of hitting one of the soft spots Heber had told her about,
            and managed to land a kick into his groin. He let her go with a yelled curse
and she ran.</p>

            <p>“You little
            bastard!” she heard the farmer roar, but she was already at the end of the
            narrow aisle, her feet beating the dusty ground for all she had. Though she was
            the fastest rat on the street, she knew she wasn't going to hold out for long
            with her empty belly, and she had no chance of outrunning the city watch or any
            adult at the market with their legs longer than hers. Already she felt tired
            and weak from the prolonged lack of food. Her only hope was to round a corner
and melt into the crowd and disappear that way.</p>

            <p>Which meant
            that she had to slow down after a few turns and force herself to walk slowly
            again, as if she hadn't just been caught stealing and escaped, as if she had
            all the time in the world and her heart wasn't racing faster than the city
            watch would have her in the stocks, just another slacking farmhand who could
afford the leisurely gait.</p>

            <p>After a few
            minutes the sounds of pursuit and imminent danger had faded, but her stomach
            was still cramping and clenching. Should she stay and try her luck with another
            merchant or would it be better to return to the alley with her belly empty, and
hope she would wake up tomorrow morning?</p>

            <p>Her stomach
            answered the question with a loud growl. It had been two days already since
            she'd last eaten anything solid, and while she had long gotten used to scarce
            meals she was sure a human being couldn't last longer than a few days without
sustenance.</p>

            <p>But it would be
            even riskier now than before. One failed attempt alerted other merchants to the
            presence of a thief, and most of them knew that thieves had to eat like any
other people and thus might try again if the first attempt failed.</p>

            <p>Oria wandered
            aimlessly through the bazaar, waiting for the dust to settle and the tumult's
            aftermath to die down, taking her time to scour the environment carefully, when
            she experienced a familiar prickle in the back of her neck. Somebody was
            watching her. But who? Suspicious farmer or vigilant guard? Asteroid miner?
            Seirios cultist? Or something else entirely? It was difficult to tell with so
many perils to consider.</p>

            <p>Without raising
            her head Oria cast a covert look around the Hall. She couldn't afford another
            slip. She had to be prepared for everything and anything, even a fast getaway
            onto the derelict roofs or into the labyrinth of crookback alleys that started
just north of the market, where she could lose herself in the wynds.</p>

            <p>Nothing moved
and nobody was watching her, and she continued her quest for survival uneasily.</p>

            <p>Half an hour
            later she had found her second target. The feeling of being watched hadn't
            left, but increased instead. Her new target was larger than the last, but
            stocked with less variety: no fresh vegetables or fruit, but there was
            livestock around. Mooing cattle and noisy chickens would help to conceal her
endeavour from the owner's sharp eyes if she was quick.</p>

            <p>She looked over
            her should as she ambled toward the stall. She couldn't see anybody behind her,
            or anybody lurking nearby, yet she was sure the same somebody she had noticed
before still had her in their field of vision.</p>

            <p>But who could
            be interested in the small acolyte she currently impersonated? She had
            experienced stares of older men before, when she had still walked the streets
            without the anonymity that came with being just another boy, another slacking
            farmhand, but they normally left her alone when she wore her cap low, but this
            felt different. Had the cultivator followed her? She was almost at the stall.
            Close enough that if she stretched her hand she could snatch an egg from its
            wickerwork basket. But she needed to stay calm and do it at the last moment, or
recent history would repeat itself.</p>

            <p>The feeling of
being watched peaked.</p>

            <p>Oria's head
            snapped around. Nobody looked back at her. Nonetheless she darted away from the
            display and the chickens and vanished back into the crowd without having made
an attempt for the loaf. Cursing, she slowed to a halt several aisles away.</p>

            <p>What was wrong
            with today? Was she imagining things? Who would be watching her? Were they
            waiting for her to slip up so they could detain her? But that was absurd. The
            city watch didn't need an excuse to pick up streets rats and hang them on the
            square before the Hall of Harvest. Her head throbbed painfully though it felt
            as light as water, and her belly twinged every other second now, demanding to
be filled, yet every time she tried to, something got in the way.</p>

            <p>But at least
            one advantage had come off the latest haphazard flight. Her observer had lost her
trail.</p>

            <p>Oria slowed
            down around a corner, resumed her leisurely pace, and began to whistle the same
            off-key tune all farmhands knew, a dry and whispy sound because she had avoided
            the dirty water of the communal well for at least half a day as well, until she
            gathered enough courage to try again. She was running out of options fast. She
            needed food and she needed water, and if it didn't happen soon she could just
            as well lay down and surrender on the spot. Hanging would be an easier death
than that of hunger or cold.</p>

            <p>But not yet.</p>

            <p>Oria found
            another stall that looked promising, with cages of chicken and heaps of
            potatoes and beets on its wooden display. Vegetables wouldn't fill her stomach
            for long, or at all, but it was better suited to still some of the hunger than
air.</p>

            <p>She continued
            to whistle as she closed in on the stall. The merchant was an older woman. If
            she was lucky and the woman had a shred of kindness in her heart, she would get
away without being hung or beheaded today. She doubted it.</p>

            <p>She was almost
at the stall when a shout erupted behind her.</p>

            <p>“That's the
            bastard!” yelled a familiar yet unwelcome voice, and Oria cast a look over her
            shoulder to see that they were on her trail: ten or so armed guards of the city
            watch and the first farmer she had tried her luck at, his face beet red with
anger.</p>

            <p>She froze for
            the tiniest moment, then her senses sharpened as if pulled over a grindstone's
            edge and her instinct propelled her forward into the crowd. They had been
            following her and she hadn't noticed. Ten uniformed guardsmen with the
            Administrative Council symbol on their chest who carried blades and other
weapons, some what looked like pistols.</p>

            <p>Oria darted
            sideways into an alley and zigzagged out of it at the far end, turned sharply
            and skidded into the next, where she found her way blocked by another cluster
            of uniform-clad law enforcers. How many were in on this chase? One mistake and
she would be done for.</p>

            <p>She whirled
            around on the spot and sprinted down the alley to her right instead, her legs
            barely holding her up, and her head spinning worse than ever from thirst.
            Another turn and she was back at the southern side of the market, where the
well-maintained farm road led toward the farmer's council's headquarters.</p>

            <p>She lost the
            soles of her shoes somewhere along the road. Her feet patterned over the ground
            bare, catching on pieces of colourful glass and sharp splinters of wood and
masonry, remnants of the glorious city that Oblivion had once been.</p>

            <p>She ran into
            something solid, but spongy. A glance upward told her it was the astronomically
dimensioned woman she had seen before.</p>

            <p>Yells and
            insults assaulted her ears from behind. Her belly groaned. Her head felt airy
and liquid enough as if it weren't connected to her neck any more.</p>

            <p>Oria knew no
            bridges or ladders or secret crevices and hideouts in this part of the city,
            where the merchant's Council hunted down street rats even more fiercely than
they did in the northern district, which primarily belonged to the Priesthood.</p>

            <p>“Got you!” the
            cultivator's snarl came from behind. He was right. She was trapped. There was
            no way past the woman or out of the gathering crowd. Oria tried to extract
            herself, but someone grabbed her arm tightly. Tingles crept up her spine at the
touch.</p>

            <p>“What is the
meaning of this?” the woman's high-pitched voice demanded.</p>

            <p>Oria yanked
against the hold on her arm. “Let me go!”</p>

            <p>The cultivator
snarled. “You little thief.”</p>

            <p>“Thief?” the
woman sneered. “This acolyte –“</p>

            <p>“Is not an
acolyte!”</p>

            <p>“He offended
me!” the woman shrieked.</p>

            <p>“This is an
urchin. A street –“</p>

            <p>It wasn't until
            a moment later that silence fell suddenly. The crowd parted. Oria's neck
            chilled. The man was clad in black, sleeves trimmed in red and grey. His eyes
alighted on her like the sharp claws of a hawk, sinking into her skin.</p>

            <p>“What is the
            meaning of this?” he asked in a slow, almost disinterested, and inherently cold
voice.</p>

            <p>“I didn't do
it!” Oria yelled.</p>

            <p>“This acolyte
            offended me!” the woman shrieked, clutching the man's arm. His nose wrinkled at
the touch.</p>

            <p>At the same
            moment the cultivator said, “This urchin tried to steal from me. He is a street
            rat. Do you see the clothes? He must have stolen them somewhere – He is a
murderer!”</p>

            <p>“I'm not!” Oria
shrieked, mortified at the high-pitched squeak of her voice.</p>

            <p>“He?” the
            newcomer asked. His eyes bored into hers like frozen stars. They were so cold
            in his otherwise would-be handsome face that Oria felt a chill creep down her
neck as he regarded her. “This is a girl...”</p>

            <p>“No!” she
screamed.</p>

            <p>“A street rat
            you say?” the newcomer's eyes pierced painfully into hers. His gaze went down
            to her shoes, revealed by the earlier flight. “Perhaps we should call the
cultists to deal with her.”</p>

            <p>“NO!”</p>

            <p>Not the
            cultists! They were a convergence of insane priests and
            cultists who worshipped the binary star like she would a roast ox. They would make her into a worship-doll! They'd drug her with these
            little morphine pills they smoked to make her pliable and make her do all kinds
            of things she didn't want. That's what happened to girls. Boys might become
acolytes, but girls were only useful as oracles and prophets of the Seirios.</p>

            <p>No!</p>

            <p>Oria struggled
            against the cultivator's vice-like grip as the newcomer turned to wave over a
            runner to go to the Chantry. His hold on her tightened, and the newcomer
            crouched to look at her more closely. He was tall and dark and his nose had a
            hawk-like hook to it. His frozen eyes scanned hers as if he wanted to devour
her then and there like the predator he was.</p>

            <p>Oria held
            herself still and then suddenly kicked out. Her foot connected with the man's
            shin and he gave a grunt of perhaps annoyance rather than pain. He lifted a
            hand and slapped her in the face so that her head lolled backward and Oria
kicked again.</p>

            <p>At the same
            time something else happened: an object flew through the air and impacted with
            the cultivator's eye. He let go of her arm with a shriek and Oria stumbled
forward. Away. She had to get away.</p>

            <p>But there was
            no way to go! Already the city watch closed, their weapons clinking and
            clattering like the chains they would use to tie her to the stocks, and her
            feet stung so badly where they had scampered over debris of wood and broken
glass that it was a miracle she was still standing at all.</p>

            <p>Where could she
go? There was no way –</p>

            <p>“Come on!” a
            voice yelled: a boy's voice all, but deep enough to be a teenager's instead of
a child's. “Follow me!”</p>
