            <p></p>

            <p>What was she to
            do? She didn't have any will or strength left to argue, and whoever the boy was
            he had to be the better choice than the guards, so she followed the thin blur
            of him she could make out in the semi-dark. They wound through the
            crisscrossing wynds for several minutes, always in earshot of the clattering
            and cursing guards and the red-faced merchant, then the boy abruptly turned
            into an alley and made for what looked like a barely visible hatch in the
ground.</p>

            <p>An old manhole!</p>

            <p>“Quick!” He
            fiddled open the hatch and pushed her down a short, narrow flight of steps into
an even blacker darkness than above.</p>

            <p>Oria stumbled
            down the steps and after several seconds came to a halt at the black bottom of
            the staircase, while the boy pulled the hatch shut, drowning them in darkness
            and muffling the noise overhead. They waited. Oria's nerves strained as she
            listened to the noise of heavy boots and confused guardsmen yelling overhead.
            If they didn't know the all-, but-invisible hatch through which they had
            slipped into the underground was there they'd never be able to distinguish it
from the dirty ground.</p>

            <p>Not when they
believed they were still chasing quarry that ran instead of hid.</p>

            <p>They waited
            until the only sounds were their laboured breaths. Then the boy produced a
            torch and the underground ignited with a bright light that for a split second
            framed him and made him look like one of the guardian spirits Heber believed
            watched over every man. Then the light dimmed as the energy source flickered
and she could make out his slight and dirty form without blinding her vision.</p>

            <p>He was about
            her age. His arms were spindly thin and skeletal as hers and his ragged clothes
            clung to his emaciated body only because they stuck to his skin with dirt and
            sweat. His hair was light, but covered in so much mud it appeared dark where it
            was touched by torchlight and fell over protruding ears. But his green eyes
            were bright, though his freckled face was dirty, and gleamed in the darkness as
if they were illuminated by the spark of life.</p>

            <p>He kept one
hand behind his back as they eyed each other suspiciously.</p>

            <p>Did he have a
            weapon? Was he going to attack her now? Did he mean to rob her? She distanced
            herself from him. He didn't look like much. She might be able to fight him off.
If only her head would stop aching so badly it warped her sight.</p>

            <p>The silence
stretched.</p>

            <p>What was she
supposed to say?</p>

            <p>“I was watching
            you,” the boy said at last. “Watched you on the theft. That was a stupid thing
to do.”</p>

            <p>Her anger
sparked. Who was this boy to berate her?</p>

            <p>“What's that
            supposed to mean?” she snapped and let gaze trail over his ragged clothes and
dirty outfit. “You're a thief too.”</p>

            <p>His nose
            wrinkled. “I don't mean the stealing.” He averted his eyes and his voice was
            higher in the way of boys turning to teenagers when he continued “everyone
steals. I mean stealing when the Administrator is around.”</p>

            <p>Her nostrils
flared. “You're stupid.”</p>

            <p>His gaze went
to his concealed hand again.</p>

            <p>What was he
            trying to hide? Had he meant to attack her he would have done so by now
wouldn't he?</p>

            <p>He took a step
back and looked her over again. “You're a girl.”</p>

            <p>His nose
wrinkled.</p>

            <p>“So?” Oria
snapped.</p>

            <p>“So nothing.”
            His previously concealed hand lifted to scratch his scalp and it looked oddly
            claw-like in the flickering light of the torch yet did not shine like metal.
            Her eyebrows crinkled. Did he have a weapon or not? The flicker of sharp edges
            and the gleaming wetness like water on a metal knife object? was too quick for
            her to be sure. He seemed to become aware of her gaze and dropped his hand
hastily. “What?”</p>

            <p>The fight went
            out of her. Her vision was tired. She was hungry and cold. She had no strength
left to argue. “Nth.”</p>

            <p>He waited
            another moment. Then he shrugged and turned around as if uneasy under her
glare.</p>

            <p>“Go for the
            ones close north next time” he said. “Not many people on the bad spots up
north.”</p>

            <p>He turned to
leave.</p>

            <p>“Where are you
            going?” Oria demanded. She didn't want to be left alone in the all-consuming
            darkness of the sewer tunnel, and though she hated to admit it even to herself,
she thought she could use his help just now.</p>

            <p>Her cry echoed
eerily in the spacious surroundings.</p>

            <p>The boy didn't
            reply. Oria picked herself off the ground and staggered after him, unable to
walk straight on her cut and blistered feet.</p>

            <p>“You can't just
            leave me here!” she tried to shout, but her voice had lost its strength after
            the first outcry, and angry tears welled in her eyes at how weak she was and
            sounded. On top of that she was still tired and hungry, a combination that made
her volatile and angry. “Wait! Where am I supposed to go?”</p>

            <p>The boy
hesitated.</p>

            <p>“That's your
problem,” he said.</p>

            <p>“Don't just
leave me here!” she cried as he turned away again.</p>

            <p>She didn't
            understand. He had saved her from the guards, but was going to let her starve
            alone in the darkness? He hadn't even tried to rob her and didn't seem to want
to, but why else had he saved her?</p>

            <p>Again the boy
            halted shortly, a twitch of reluctance in his gait, but he didn't turn around
as he spoke.</p>

            <p>“I can't help
you.”</p>

            <p>“Just a place
            to sleep,” she pleaded, hating herself, because of how weak she sounded. But
            her soles burned. The moccasins had dissolved almost entirely and every step
sent jagged pain through her feet.</p>

            <p>She could tell
            he wanted to help her by the way he hadn't fled yet and seemed to be warring
with himself, as she would if somebody asked her to take them in.</p>

            <p>“Just one
            night.” Oria stumbled over her feet and at last landing on the cold stone
            ground. If it was her making the decision, she knew she would kick herself out
            of the hiding place no sooner than she entered it. In fact, she would not have
            been soft enough to help a little rat like herself escape at all. And if, if
            she for some reason found herself in his situation, then she might have helped
her escape, but she would not have taken her down to the hideout.</p>

            <p>But this boy
            was different. His conscience seemed to win the battle as he looked at her on
the ground.</p>

            <p>“One night,” he
said warily. “One night – that's all – and then you leave.”</p>

            <p>Oria nodded
            with relief. The boy approached her, crouched, and hauled her off the ground
with a strength his thin arms shouldn't possess. “I'm Quinn,” he said, and though she was tired, she couldn't help wondering, scathingly,
                                what did it matter? What did his name matter? He had made it clear he would
throw her out on the street in the morning. And he was only another little rat.</p>

            <p>“I'm Oria,” she responded weakly. It sounded off to
                say it out loud. The only person who ever used her name was Heber, and she
                would rather he didn't. A quiet shudder ran down her back at the thought. In
                fact, it had been Heber who told her her name when she had been little, and
                when he still hoped to keep her with him like a daughter. He'd called her niece,
                then, and sometimes child, and he made sure she ate, even if it meant he went
                hungry more often than not. Her eyes suddenly stung, and she pushed the thought
                away. Things had changed. There was no need to think of the past. Heber could
                no longer help her now that his sister was so ill, and she didn't want his help
anyway.</p>

            <p>Quinn's voice
broke through her thoughts.</p>

            <p>“Oria? Like the
Star?”</p>

            <p>“No. Seirios
means scorcher. Oria means burning.”</p>

            <p>Quinn lifted an
            eyebrow at her as if it was the same still and she bared her teeth at him even
as she wobbled once again on her feet.</p>

            <p>“Are you – are
you sick?” he asked.</p>

            <p>Oria shook her
            head. She had been born after the radiation Cataclysm that preceded the star's
            birth and Heber made sure she got the usual vaccines at least once a year –
            which she didn't mind. There was nothing as bad as catching one of the diseases
            they had been able to cure thirteen years ago, but which now meant a certain
and painful death.</p>

            <p>He still looked
at her suspiciously.</p>

            <p>“Just don't die
on me – okay? I don't wanna have to deal with a body.”</p>

            <p>They crossed an
            underground bridge over the sewer, staggered up a short ramp on the other side,
            and headed toward what looked like an old tool room. Quinn hesitated again
before its plain door, but now his reluctance made sense to her.
                    He hadn't minded helping her escape the inquisitors, who had to be a
                burden to him as well, but was understandably reluctant to share his secret
                hideout with her. In a place like Oblivion you had to keep your secrets safe or
somebody just as wanting and needy as yourself was going to steal them.</p>

            <p>At the
threshold he stood himself before her with his back to the room.</p>

            <p>“You sure you
ain't sick?”</p>

            <p>Her stomach
            hurt. Her feet bristled with the heat of hundreds of tiny wood-jabs and
metal-scrapes and glass-pinprick-scratches.</p>

            <p>“I'm sure.”</p>

            <p>“I – uh – just
            don't touch anything,” he said warily, still sounding as if he didn't think
this were a good idea.</p>

            <p>“I won't,” said
Oria.</p>

            <p>He led her into
            the small tool room and dumped her just beyond the doorway, as if she were a
            sack of dirt. He walked over to an old cupboard and began to take several
            undoubtedly stolen things from under his torn shirt while she took in the new
surroundings.</p>

            <p>The tool room
            was warmer than her alley above ground, but the floor was cold as white winter
            frost and harder than the sandy earth in her wynd. There was a drainage pipe
            and a water-filled bucket beneath it in one corner, collecting the steady drip
            from above, a slim and dirty straw mattress in the opposite, and what looked like
            a makeshift toilet left of the entrance, a wooden plank with a hole in the
            middle and a barrel below, which stank of excrement though the lid above the
            hole was closed. Behind the toilet, a trickle of tiny footsteps shuffled like
those of rats.</p>

            <p>Oria turned her
            head back to where Quinn was sorting his bounty. Half a loaf of bread, three
            large potatoes, a handful of chick peas, a string of leather, a starfruit, and
a pair of thick sausages had involuntarily found their way into his possession.</p>

            <p>Her eyes lingered
            on the sausages. Real meat. He must have had a good day out there on the
            streets before he found her. She hadn't had meat since she caught that skinny
rat swimming down the canal.</p>

            <p>“That's a lot
of food,” she said. Her stomach panged with hunger.</p>

            <p>Quinn's gaze
            lifted warily, as if wondering whether she would attack him for a morsel. Truth
            be told she had thought about it the moment he divulged his loot, but then she
            remembered that he had just saved her life and it would be poor repayment for
the favour if she robbed him then.</p>

            <p>He must have
guessed her thoughts by the way her shoulders relaxed.</p>

            <p>“It's not that
            much” he said. He continued to sort. The bread and sausages onto the straw
            mattress to be consumed right away, the chick peas and potatoes into a rusty
            pot to be cooked later, the leather string to the others that hung around his
            waist. The starfruit he laid onto the edge of the destroyed pillowcase at the
head of the straw bed.</p>

            <p>Her mouth
watered and she forced herself to swallow despite the scratching in her throat.</p>

            <p>“Where did you
get it?”</p>

            <p>“Just scouting”
he said.</p>

            <p>“Scouting
where?”</p>

            <p>He opened his
            mouth then shut it again. He sat on the mattress and ripped a chunk off the
            loaf. Then he divided the piece again and again until it was in pieces barely
            larger than his palm and popped one of the slivers into his mouth, chewing
            slowly and carefully, as if by taking his time the food would somehow multiply
            in his mouth. Just watching made her own mouth water and her stomach twist. It
            was getting more and more difficult not to attack him or at least search for
            the origin of the shuffling noise. Her stomach growled as he bit into one of
the sausages and the rich smell of meat and spices wafted toward her.</p>

            <p>She couldn't
help herself.</p>

            <p>“Can I have
something?” Her mouth and throat were so dry now that swallowing hurt.</p>

            <p>He looked up in
alarm.</p>

            <p>“Have
            something?” His hand twisted to shield the food he was holding protectively.
“No.”</p>

            <p>Her stomach
growled.</p>

            <p>“Then why save
me if you're going to let me die?” she snapped.</p>

            <p>Quinn seemed to
            consider. His brows furrowed and a grimly guarded expression settled on his
filth-crusted face.</p>

            <p>But her
argument seemed to make sense to him.</p>

            <p>“Fine,” he said
            reluctantly, taking a piece of bread and half of a sausage and rolling it over
the floor toward her. “But not more than that.”</p>

            <p>The first bite
            of the bread was like the sugary taste she imagined of a starfruit. Oria forced
            herself to chew as slowly as he did, knowing the consequences of what would
            happen if she didn't, having made that mistake once and regretted it instantly
            when a day's hard scavenging splattered onto the sandy ground of her alley,
where it mixed irrecoverably with dust and dirt.</p>

            <p>Her stomach
            still twinged when she had finished her meagre meal, and there was not a drop
            of spit left on her painfully dry tongue. Her gaze fell again on the bucket
under the slowly dripping drainage pipe.</p>

            <p>“Is that water
clean?” she asked Quinn.</p>

            <p>He shrugged.</p>

            <p>“Clean as any
            Dirt Rain,” he said, taking no break devouring the second half of his sausage
and bread.</p>

            <p>Clean as muddy
            water sounded just well when she was about to die of thirst. “Can I have a
bit?”</p>

            <p>He gave a nod
            and watched her crawl to the bucket to cup some water into her palms and bring
            it to her lips. The water was brownish and tasted brackish – as if it had stood
            in its rusty bucket for a while. When was the last time it rained? But even
            this was better than the water from the well. Once done she crawled back to her
            corner and curled up against the damp wall so she would be less of a target for
            the cold. He was still eating, chewing even slower than before now that his
            ration was almost gone, and watching her intensely from underneath the matted
strands of his once sandy blond hair.</p>

            <p>“The Chantry,”
he said suddenly.</p>

            <p>Oria blinked
and craned her neck to look at him.</p>

            <p>“What?”</p>

            <p>“They have a
            secret cellar on the grounds,” he said. “But it's very difficult to get there
            if you don't know where it is.” His tone left no doubt he wouldn't have told
            her if the storage was easily found. “There's a lock that's very hard to open
even if you find it. I only got lucky because they forgot to close the hatch.”</p>

            <p>They stared at
            each other for a moment. Quinn's cheeks had darkened under the layer of dirt,
            as if he thought he had said too much. Oria thought he must be lying to protect
            his secret. The Chantry was the headquarters of the Seirios Cult. But the
            priests weren't as fat and wealthy as the farmers, but exceptionally poor for
all their misplaced faith.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless.</p>

            <p>“Can you show
me?” she asked.</p>

            <p>His expression
drew away. He shook his head.</p>

            <p>Neither of them
            knew what else to say, though now that her stomach was at least half full she
            wanted to know all about the Chantry and their hidden stash of food. Yet she
            doubted he would tell her more than he already had. Rats couldn't afford to
            share such precious information with somebody who was just as needy as oneself
            – at least she was sure she wouldn't have told him anything had she been the
one with the knowledge.</p>

            <p>Quinn's
            enormous ears glowed as well as he began to form a nest of rags and old scraps
of carpets on the straw mattress.</p>

            <p>Oria pulled off
            her blanket cape and used it to cushion the hard floor, while he curled up next
            to the starfruit, gazing at it longingly, but it brought no relief from the
            cold. Maybe she should leave and go back to the upside now that her stomach had
            been calmed somewhat. The alley ground would be warmer than the hard stone
            floor of the tool room. But now that she considered taking the whole trip back
            to the Chantry and wandering the dark streets back to her alley alone, she
thought she would be safer staying with Quinn for the night.</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>Oria woke to
            the sound of pattering drops on the metal roof. It rained, which meant that
            they had to stay underground because of the acid and dirt that came down in what
            they commonly, and only after the Cataclysm, called Dirt Rain. Under any other
            circumstances she would have found shelter upon seeing the sickly yellow clouds
            that heralded the Dirt Rain, even with Heber if she must, but now she listened
            to the dull drops falling onto the dusty earth above from the safety of the
tool room, and braced herself to argue with Quinn should he insist she leave.</p>

            <p>“You want to go
out in this dirt rain?” he asked.</p>

            <p>“You said one
night.”</p>

            <p>He didn't
respond.</p>

            <p>“Do you mind if
I stay?”</p>

            <p>He shrugged.</p>

            <p>But he didn't.
            He lay curled in a ball on the straw bed, his bad hand clutched to his thin
            chest, listening to the rhythmic splashes into the bucket from the drainage
            pipe, occasionally casting a look at where she sat wrapped in her blanket. He
            only moved from his spot under the thin cloak when he changed the torch. Under
            his thin cape she could see the black fingers of the diseased hand twitch and
            spasm occasionally, and despite herself wondered if it hurt. While Quinn saved
            her life from the city watch she couldn't allow herself to care, as she already
            had her own mouth to feed, and old grandpa's, and that of Heber and his sister
sometimes as well.</p>

            <p>Her stomach
rumbled. Heber.</p>

            <p>In the haze of
            last night she had completely forgotten to see how he was doing, and with the
            Dirt Rain coming down like bucketfuls of well water, and not a grain of food to
her name, it was questionable she would be able to do it today.</p>

            <p>Her gaze fell
            on the raw potatoes and chick peas in Quinn's cupboard, and the fruit which he
            was still clutching to his skinny chest. If they could get a fire started maybe
they could boil the potatoes and bring the old man a warm meal.</p>

            <p>No.</p>

            <p>She dismissed
            the thought. Quinn wouldn't want to share his hard-earned food with an old man
            he didn't know and she wasn't going to steal it. She might be a street rat, but
she had some sort of code of honour still.</p>

            <p>Oria's dark
            eyes moved upward and met his light ones, but he looked away quickly. Though
            she couldn't see the sky from the tool room, she supposed it was nightfall when
he finally broke the day-long silence.</p>

            <p>“What?” she
asked.</p>

            <p>He turned his
gaze away.</p>

            <p>“Nothing.”</p>

            <p>She would have
left it at that if it weren't for the glances he kept shooting her afterwards.</p>

            <p>“What?” she
said again.</p>

            <p>“Where are your
            parents?” he asked though she wasn't sure whether he was asking her or the xx
in his hand.</p>

            <p>She scowled.
            Did it matter where her parents were? They weren't there to feed them and that
            was enough. The silence stretched. The boy blushed. His left hand still shook
slightly under the frayed cloak, and Oria wondered whether it ever stopped.</p>

            <p>“Never mind,”
            he mumbled a moment later, still looking at the starfruit instead of her, his
thumb brushing over it almost tenderly.</p>

            <p>“I don't know”
Oria said. She didn't care to know. “I don't remember them.”</p>

            <p>“Oh.”</p>

            <p>“Where are
yours?”</p>

            <p>The boy's
            dirt-streaked face lit up as if he had been waiting for her to ask. “My parents
            are –“ His face fell. “– were doctors at the Consortium of Science.” His face
fell and she took that to mean they were dead. “They – they died.”</p>

            <p>His story
            wasn't unusual. She had heard it several times before in different variations
            when she talked to the other street rats about their history. She didn't know
            whether she should pity him still clinging to parents who had abandoned him or
            envy him because he at least had memories of his mom and dad. What made his
            story different was that the other rats had been strangers and while he was as
            well he saved her life and shared with her his hideout if only for the night
and she couldn't help, but listen when he continued.</p>

            <p>She tired to
            imagine the boy with his mom and dad. It was a strange thought. He was a street
            rat – a rat still clinging to his parents, but a rat nonetheless. And yet...
            Did he have grandparents? Did he still have any family like she did Heber?
            Heber used to explain how in the old times the elderly played an important role
            to their families. They kept tradition and wisdom, but the Cataclysm destroyed
            their minds and often souls before they could be vaccinated. Heber was the only
            older person she knew and he wasn't that old. He wasn't as old as the
            cultivators and younger than most adults she knew from sight. At one point when
            they'd been calculating Earth-ages in his kitchen he claimed to be thirty-six,
            but she didn't know exactly how old he would be the 800 days she counted had
            passed since then. For the rest of the patients the vaccine had been too late
            to restore their damaged mind and failed bodies – even the farmer's old people
hadn't fared much better in those first days after the Seirios collapsed.</p>

            <p>“That's nice,”
            she said because she didn't know what else she could say. Not having known her
            real family, she had always considered Heber as something like her father, even
            if he was the most persistently annoying adult she knew. But Heber had never
            shared starfruit or anything, but useless information with her. He didn't have
            anything more to share than anybody else did, though, and that was nothing, so
maybe he really wasn't that different from a real father to her.</p>

            <p>Oria had no
            memory of a mother or father and normally didn't think about them either.
            Whoever they were they had left her, and their memory was no use to her in the
daily struggle for survival.</p>

            <p>Quinn looked
            for a moment as if he wanted to say something more, but didn't. Instead he
            blushed somewhat darkly and turned his face away from her as if he were ashamed
            to have pried. Did he still have parents? If so: where were they? And even if
            he knew, it seemed to personal for a stranger like her to ask such personal
questions.</p>

            <p>Quinn nodded.
            His gaze had turned dark and looked faraway, as if his mind had left and gone
            back in time to a better life. He spanned out of it a moment later and traced a
            fingernail of his good hand along the starfruit's soft peel. Oria could see
            that the nail was rosy clean and carefully cut despite the rest of his muddled
appearance. He must have gone through some trouble to keep it that way.</p>

            <p>Her gaze fell
            again onto the starfruit on Quinn's old pillowcase, which throned there like
the Seirios system did atop the Hall of Harvest. “I've never had that.”</p>

            <p>“They used to
            buy it for us” he said. “When they still had the old currency before the
Cataclysm instead of trading for value.</p>

            <p>“What does it
            taste like?” she asked. Heber had always enjoyed her curiosity much more than
            she had, though he had cautioned that it might kill her at some point if she
            wasn't careful. But then – Heber believed that just about everything could and
would kill her if given the chance.</p>

            <p>The boy's
            expression turned guarded and the starfruit was gripped tightly in his good
hand.</p>

            <p>“I was going to
save it” he said.</p>

            <p>She stared.
            Nobody sane ever saved food, especially not food that spoiled as quickly as
fruit and vegetables did.</p>

            <p>He caught her
            gaze and seemed to realize the same thing, upon which his brows furrowed. “I
suppose we could share.”</p>

            <p>He broke the
            starfruit apart and pushed her smaller half at her feet. It toppled over before
            it reached her and dirt stuck to the soft flesh, but she wasn't going to
            complain when he so willingly shared his food. Despite the dust she couldn't
            get off it tasted heavenly, just as Heber had promised it would, though she
wasn't sure whether that wasn't the hunger addling the taste.</p>

            <p>Her stomach was
clearly dissatisfied with the tiny amount.</p>

            <p>“Can we also
            share that?” she asked, pointing hopefully at the potatoes and chick peas in
their pot.</p>

            <p>Quinn hadn't
touched his half of the starfruit yet and now bit his lip.</p>

            <p>“Tomorrow,” he
            said reluctantly, which was more than she had expected. “If it still rains.” He
            rolled onto his feet and went over to the cupboard, clutching the starfruit to
            him as if scared she would steal it if he left it alone. He rummaged for a
            moment and produced an old tin pot. “We'll have to boil it first. Tomorrow. You
            can't eat those raw or you'll get sick.” Oria thought that sick was better than
            dead, but he put the pot next to the pile of dried canal-driftwood and made his
way back to the rag-bed in near darkness.</p>

            <p>When he finally
            ate his piece of the starfruit several hours later, she thought there was
            something glittery in his eyes, but she couldn't be sure as the torchlight
played tricks on her own eyes in the crammed room.</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>The rain
            proceeded into the next day and then the night, the air inside the tool room
            became damp and stale, but at least the stink of excrement faded somewhat as
            her nose got used to it. They collected driftwood along the underground canal's
            edges during the day, cooked the potatoes and chick peas in the evening, and
            stretched their meal with dirt water from the corner bucket. Oria set most of
            her portion aside for the old man however, thinking he must be famished by now,
not having received any food for the past three days and a half.</p>

            <p>“Don't you want
            that?” Quinn asked. Clearly her denial took him aback. Nobody could afford to
not eat food.</p>

            <p>“I want to give
            it to someone,” Oria said by way of explanation. “He can't steal food or
anything himself.”</p>

            <p>“You said you
didn't have family,” Quinn said accusingly.</p>

            <p>“He's not
            family,” she said, and couldn't begrudge him the look of disbelief. Nobody
shared food with somebody who wasn't family and had nothing to trade for it.</p>

            <p>Quinn chewed
soundlessly for a moment, looking for something else to say.</p>

            <p>“You're going
            out in that Dirt Rain?” he asked, eyes wide and alert, yet looking most
displeased at the same time.</p>

            <p>She shrugged.
“They'll go bad if you don't cook/eat them.”</p>

            <p>But that wasn't
            the only reasons she wanted to go outside. The sticky tightness of the tool
            room and lack of light were oppressing, and they made her queasy after a while,
            as if she were already dead and buried, and on top of that she wanted to pay a
            visit to the Chantry. If Quinn had told her the truth on the first day, which
            she thought he might have because of the horror in his face when he'd realized
            it, and there was much more food to swipe there than at the market, she might
            never have to worry about the farmers and the city watch again; the high
            society didn't care much more for the shady cultists, who they left alone
            because of the insanity-sickness, than they did for street rats, who they
            thought should be exterminated like so much vermin on their planet, so she was
            much less likely to be caught in that area, which was usually abandoned and
unprotected by the Council.</p>

            <p>Oria and Quinn
            stared at each other momentarily, unsure what to say now they were about to
part, unsure whether they would meet again.</p>

            <p>“Are you coming
            back?” Quinn finally asked. Did he want her to? It was impossible to tell with
his gaze now fixed on his diseased hand.</p>

            <p>“Should I?”</p>

            <p>Did she want
            to? She couldn't deny that Quinn's presence had been a nice change from the
            monotony of her silent alley, as was the comfort of the tool room once you got
            used to the smell, but sticking together meant there was a possibility she
            could start to care and become attached, the last thing in the world she
            wanted. Quinn turned away and shrugged, but not quickly enough to look
            convincing, so she thought she should. Just for one more night, then she would
be off on her own again.</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>As soon as the
            rain stopped Oria took the steps out into the open two at a time and with
            evident relief. She was still hungry and cold, but she hadn't seen daylight, or
            the sky itself, for at least two days now, and was eager to get out of the
            suffocating darkness of their hideout. The only problem was her missing cap,
            and what it meant if anybody, a man, a miner, spotted a young girl walking
            through the darkness on her own, yet it bothered her little as her lungs filled
with the first breath of relatively clean outside air.</p>

            <p>She dashed
            through the dirt rain toward the Hall of Harvest, shielding her head and face
            with the piece of cloth in which she had packed the old man's food, nonetheless
            feeling the acidic drops sting on her bare fingers and scalp, until she was
            safely back under the canopy at the market. She stood for a moment, panting,
            and then wound her way through the sheltered market and the alleys behind it
            towards her goal. The old man lived in one of those alleys and she spotted him
            and his animal quickly. The fleabag, a hairy four-legged creatures, about as
            tall as her hip and shaggy, dirty brown furred, came upright and bounced its
tail up and down in the puddles and mud as it saw her.</p>

            <p>“Is it you,
            Oria?” the blind old man said in a raised voice that suggested he was going
            deaf as well. He lifted his thin arms and ran his wizened fingers gently over
            her now-closed eyes and lips and nose. Not once, she realized, had he poked her
            in the eye when doing that, though he couldn't see anything through the veil of
white above the pale grey of his eyes.</p>

            <p>“It's me,
            grandpa,” she said, though he wasn't related to her, and because she would have
            liked the idea of having family had she not dreaded having to feed them as well
as herself.</p>

            <p>“I am very
            blessed to see you at such a time,” he said and sniffed the air like a dog
            picking up a trail, as did the fleabag, and she knew they had picked up the
scent of the potatoes and peas.</p>

            <p>“I brought you
food.” Oria pushed the food package into his wrinkled palms.</p>

            <p>“Potato with
            peas, and dear me, it is still warm,” the old man said with a smile that
            quickly faded. His bushy grey-white eyebrows drew together with undisguised
concern. “Oria, child, you didn't –?”</p>

            <p>“I didn't,” she
            said. It had taken her a while to figure out what he and Heber meant by
            predators taking advantage of her, as there weren't any wild beasts in the
            city, and now she was glad he couldn't see the redness of her face, as she knew
she never could be hungry enough to sink that low.</p>

            <p>He opened the
            lid of the can and scooped some of the potato mush out with his fingers,
            shovelled them between his lips and swallowed. Oria watched his Adam's apple go
            up and down and couldn't help her mouth watering at the sight, her stomach
            roaring as always, and it didn't help when the fleabag began to whine,
demanding his share.</p>

            <p>The fleabag was
            another thing Oria didn't understand. The old man barely had enough for
            himself, but he insisted on keeping the animal instead of roasting it, which
            would have fed him for a week at least. Not that she complained. She liked the
fleabag, and deemed it an asset to the old man's company.</p>

            <p>“Are there any
            news?” she asked when the old man and the fleabag were halfway through the
            food, petting the fleabag's scruffy head, just so she wouldn't stare at the
            food any longer. Granpa always had news. He heard them on the markets where he
            sometimes begged for scraps and he heard them when people thought him another
            piece of dirt or debris by the roadside. He was the ears that Heber said the
            walls had. He was invisible to cultivators and Administrators and guards, and
if the cultists saw him they ignored him.</p>

            <p>“Ah, yes,” he
            said between bites. “News.” He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and
            leaned back against the wall, the can in his fingers, and his milky eyes
            somehow finding hers. “The Cult has been more active lately,” he said. “They
            say the Seirios is increasing in radiation activity and luminosity, and that is
a sign of danger.”</p>

            <p>Was it? Oria
            asked herself. The workings of the Seirios had always sounded ominously obscure
            to her, even when Heber had explained the mechanics behind the binary star
            system, and the old man wasn't much better at communicating how that
information could be used to obtain another day.</p>

            <p>“What happens
            when the star grows?” she asked instead. That, at least, would affect all of
the city, and it was best to know what to do in such a case.</p>

            <p>“It'll burn us
            all,” said the old man, and Oria's breath caught. She knew how bad the
            Cataclysm had been, yet she never considered it could happen again. “In theory
            the Seirios could swallow the whole planet and those around it if it
            collapses,” the old man explained patiently. “It would consume Glast and grow
            into a new sun that could illuminate the rest of the solar system for the next
few millennia.”</p>

            <p>“Glast would be
gone?”</p>

            <p>“Most likely,”
said the old man, scratching the fleabag's floppy ears.</p>

            <p>“And the
cultists want that?”</p>

            <p>He looked
thoughtful for a moment.</p>

            <p>“It seems they
            do. They are saying all sort of things about absolution and the Cataclysm,
            about a whole new world that will reveal itself to them if a sacrifice is
            made.” He paused, took another scoop of the potato and pea mush. “But they do
also refer to the star as a person, a woman.”</p>

            <p>“But that's
            insane,” she protested, because his news went against everything Heber had ever
            taught her. “We will all die if the Seirios explodes, and there's nothing
beyond death!”</p>

            <p>The old man
regarded her curiously with his unseeing eyes.</p>

            <p>“Who can say?”
            He hesitated for a moment. “I would be careful to prowl the streets at night,
            Oria,” he warned in a lower voice than he had used before. “Word is the Cult is
            out to seek new members, on grounds that the shift in Seirios' activity can't
            be ignored. They claim there will be an event shortly. A big event. They claim
            it will change the history of this planet forever and they will need people to
            – uh – what was it they said? To make sure the event happens as it should.” He
            smiled at her blindly and shrugged. “They have many ideas in their heads.” Then
            he shook his head and his smile faltered. “They are not always gentle with
those they cannot persuade.”</p>

            <p>A chill ran
            over her spine at his words. The cultists were bad enough if you met them
            during the day, when they would try to persuade you to listen to their
            conspiracy and join the cause, yet the old man made it sound as if they had
            become much more ruthless at night. She thought again of morphine pills, and
            how the Chantry reeked of the smoke, and the few oracle-girls she'd seen,
            sometimes, limp like dolls, being led around by the priests' arms, drooling and
mumbling things under their breaths.</p>

            <p>“I'll keep it
in mind,” she said and stood.</p>

            <p>“Are you
leaving already?” The old man sounded disappointed.</p>

            <p>“Have you any
more news?”</p>

            <p>“I'm afraid
            that is all, but I will keep my eyes and ears open.” He smiled. “Or just my
ears.”</p>

            <p>“Then I have go
            now,” she said. “There is something I have to do tonight and it can't be done
any other day.”</p>

            <p>“Oh?” His tone
            suggested a question rather than a statement, but she wasn't ready yet to share
her knowledge in case it turned out wrong.</p>

            <p>“I can't
            promise anything, but if I'm lucky I'll have more food tomorrow,” she said
            instead. She tousled the scruff on the fleabag's head and was about to leave
            when another idea came to mind. “Can I borrow your fleabag?” It seemed a good
idea seeing she had lost her cap.</p>

            <p>“You want to
            take away an old man's eyes and nose?” he asked, but his tone was light and
teasing.</p>

            <p>“You're not
that old,” she said quickly. “I'll bring him back in the morning.”</p>

            <p>He smiled at
            her, so that she could see the holes were several of his teeth were missing,
            and for a moment she wondered whether they had been knocked out or fallen out
with age.</p>

            <p>“Take him,
            then,” he said. “He will serve you well, my dear, and hopefully, you will be
able to give him some scraps when the day is done.”</p>

            <p>Oria took the
            fleabag's leash, a piece of old cloth wrapped around its neck, and it followed
            her willingly away from the old man and toward the Chantry, avoiding the dirt
            rain by skipping under the canopies of the market. It was time to find out
whether there had been any truth in Quinn's words about the Chantry.</p>
