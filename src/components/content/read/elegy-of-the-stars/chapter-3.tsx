            <p></p>

            <p>They placed
            themselves first on the northern side of the market, under the protruding roof
            of an old place of learning, which had once housed people and their mentors, or
            so Heber had said. Now, the roof worked well as a shelter against the dirt rain
and kept the wind at bay.</p>

            <p>She could see
            the Chantry well from her spot underneath the roof, a round chapel from before
            the Cataclysm, which had still been built with stone, at a time when the
            material had been plentifully available on the planet. It hadn't burned like
            everything else had for that same reason, as stone didn't catch fire, yet the
rough surface was singed black in some places.</p>

            <p>It had a domed
            roof and the tall windows arched into points. They were made of tainted glass,
            showing images of something holy or some such, though most of which had been
replaced by depictions of the Seirios in the last few years after its creation.</p>

            <p>What she
            couldn't see, however, was a way to the pantry Quinn had spoken about. Was she
            at the wrong side of the Chantry? Should she try to get closer to the chapel?
            Inside? But the old man's warning was still fresh in her head. What if they
            decided she was as good as any new member and locked her in a dungeon? Her only
            hope was that one of the cultists would show himself and lead her to it when
            the hunger became too great. But would they go out in such rain? Or was the
pantry inside the chapel?</p>

            <p>She watched the
            Chantry for most of the evening, with the fleabag wagging its tail steadily
            against her foot, and switched sides after four hours or so in the cold. Her
            stomach began to growl louder again, almost as the fleabag did when strangers
            passed their awning, which didn't happen very often in this weather, and at the
            same time her hands and feet began to freeze, so she buried them in the
fleabag's soft fur, which it seemed to like.</p>

            <p>Around early
            morning, she saw the first inquisitor, tall and skinny, wearing a billowing
            robe the colour of fresh blood. He didn't lead her to the secret pantry, but
            made his way out of the Chantry and was quickly lost from sight in the winkled
streets.</p>

            <p>Oria sighed and
            pressed herself closer to the fleabag, who was nearly as bony as herself, the
hunger getting worse all the time.</p>

            <p>The cultist
            came back some time later and didn't leave again, and nothing else happened as
            dawn broke over the city with dim light. Quinn must have lied about the food.
            Most likely he had gotten it somewhere else and hadn't wanted to tell her, which
            was what she would have done had she known where to swipe sausages and whole
loaves of bread without getting flayed.</p>

            <p>When her
            stomach rumbled again she stood, anger churning in her stomach. She should have
            known no street rat would share a secret as important as that. She had wasted a
            whole night she could have spent finding food for herself. She tugged on the
fleabag's leash a little too harshly and pulled it along into the streets.</p>

            <p>Before, she had
            felt as if she wanted to return because of Quinn's company, yet now, she wanted
            to go back to the underground boiler room to force his secret out. But she
            still owed him a chunk of bread, half a sausage, some peas and potatoes, and
            that half of starfruit she'd eaten, and anger made her reckless as she approached
the market.</p>

            <p>They had
            erected canopies over the stands to shield the goods, which suited her and the
            fleabag fine as well, because it dimmed the light somewhat and limited the
            merchants' sight. Luck was on her side this time, she managed to swipe two eggs,
            a piece of cured ham, and a bag of black beans, a satchel of medical herbs,
            some gauze, and a scrap of leather that would hold her soles up for the next
few weeks.</p>

            <p>Oria ate one of
            the eggs as she left the market. The cultivators couldn't well ask for something
            back she had already consumed. Yet she knew that wasn't entirely true, as she
            had once watched a merchant hunt down a thief and punched the defenceless boy
so badly into the stomach he lost all the food he'd swiped.</p>

            <p>But nobody held
            her up as she wound her way out of the crowd. Maybe it was the fleabag that
            kept them away, as its kind was usually seen as plague carries and pests by
            most of the city's inhabitants. The only animals the cultivators tolerated were
            their own dogs, which could fend off thieves and guard livestock, and the cats
            that kept the rats and other vermin away from their grains and seeds and fruit
            at the price of the occasional scrap of meat. The street people liked cats as
            well for the same reason, but the old man was the only person mad enough to
            keep the fleabag, who needed twice as much food as himself. She told him so
when she returned the fleabag.</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>Her anger,
            which has subsided somewhat from the successful theft, rekindled when she made
            her way back down into the boiler room. Quinn had lied to her though he knew
            she was starving. What was worse than that, he had given her false hope and she
            had believed it like a fool. But he was taller and stronger than her, so maybe
            it wasn't best to confront him right away, even if she still had her knife, so
            she tried to keep out of the circle of torchlight to conceal her red face as
she stepped into the boiler room.</p>

            <p>Quinn's eyes
            gleamed at her from the semidarkness of his straw bed. His bad hand was still
trembling in his lap.</p>

            <p>“I thought you
            weren't coming back,” he said as she entered, concealing his hand in his torn
shirt.</p>

            <p>His words took
her aback.</p>

            <p>“I said I
would,” she said angrily.</p>

            <p>He shrugged.
“Ma and Dad said they would.”</p>

            <p>She didn't
            respond, partly because she didn't know what to say, partly because she didn't
            want to know or care, and needed to hold on her anger if she wanted to get the
truth out of him.</p>

            <p>Silence.</p>

            <p>“Why did you
            lie about the Chantry?” Oria finally demanded, taking her knife from the
            waistband of her trousers, carefully, so he wouldn't see its reflection in the
            darkness. She would stick him if he didn't tell the truth. Truly, she would,
            even if the thought of it made her skin crawl and her arms shake slightly. She
            had to, and she would, because if he'd lied to her he was truly bad, and if he
hadn't, she would take his secret and find her own way into the Chantry.</p>

            <p>Realization lit
in his eyes at her words.</p>

            <p>“I didn't,” he
said.</p>

            <p>“I was there,”
she snapped. “I watched for the whole day, and nobody ever got any food!”</p>

            <p>He sneered. “I
didn't lie” he said. “I told you it was hidden.”</p>

            <p>Her nose
            wrinkled. Her eyes narrowed. Was it true? Had she underestimated him? Had he
            mislead her on purpose? She had thought he was new to the streets, a brat who
            had grown up in safety until recently, yet his clever ruse suggested he was
            not. Not if he had managed to lie to her and fool her as he had. His cracked
            lips spread into a clever smirk at the sight of her fury, revealing crooked and
            broken teeth, yet was disarming and made her feel drawn to it, which did
nothing, but flame her temper.</p>

            <p>“Did you bring
            food?” he asked when she was silent, because she didn't know how best to
threaten him.</p>

            <p>Her jaw
            clenched. “How dare you! You lied to me and you stink!” Heber often said that
            when she showed up dirty and ragged, and then he stuck her into the washbasin
            in his house and scrubbed her with soap until her skin was raw red and stung
painfully. And yet, she couldn't deny it was good to be clean.</p>

            <p>Quinn jumped to
            his feet. “I didn't lie! I even said it was a secret entrance nobody knows
about, but the cultists! Do you think I would have told you otherwise?”</p>

            <p>“Don't come any
closer!” she raised her knife.</p>

            <p>Quinn stopped.
            Though she was sure he could see the weapon was rusty and the blade barely
            clung to its hilt, the prospect of getting stabbed and blood poisoned kept him
away.</p>

            <p>“I thought we
            could work together,” he said after a moment of silence, eyeing the knife with
            wariness. “You could stand guard while I steal food.” He shifted on his leg and
            pressed his bandaged hand to his chest. “I was lucky to get out the first time
without being caught.”</p>

            <p>Oria felt her
            eyebrows arch in disbelief. He wanted to work together? That was why he had
            saved her life? Or was this another of his clever tricks? She raised the knife higher
and backed away.</p>

            <p>“Why do I have
to stand guard?” she demanded.</p>

            <p>“Because I know
where the entrance is.”</p>

            <p>“Then show me.”</p>

            <p>“No.” He
            hesitated. “It's too dangerous. We have to be fast. There is lots of food down
there, but I can't open it alone!”</p>

            <p>“I don't
believe you,” she said. “Why would you want to work with me?”</p>

            <p>He sneered.
“Why not? Unless you're scared.”</p>

            <p>“I'm not
scared.”</p>

            <p>He grunted.</p>

            <p>What did he
take her for? A child?</p>

            <p>“I'm not.”</p>

            <p>Silence.</p>

            <p>Her gaze was
            drawn to his hand twitching on his chest. What was wrong with it? It made her
uncomfortable.</p>

            <p>“What happened
to your hand?” she asked.</p>

            <p>He wrapped it
back into the fabric of his shirt. “Nth.”</p>

            <p>Oria snarled.
“Are you sick? Do you have an infection?”</p>

            <p>“No” he curled
away. “Not an infection.”</p>

            <p>Silence.</p>

            <p>“My parents
used to give me medicine.”</p>

            <p>Did she believe
it? Reasoning.</p>

            <p>She sat down
            next to him on the mattress and shared the potato stew. He took it, watching
            her suspiciously, and sucked it empty as she had. There was a long stretch of
silence.</p>

            <p>“Did you mean
it when you said you want us to work together?” she asked.</p>

            <p>Quinn's eyes
sharpened. He gave a nod. “We can try.”</p>

            <p>“Like a gang of
thieves?” she asked. The idea was both ridiculous and strangely appealing.</p>

            <p>The corners of
his lips twitched.</p>

            <p>“I thought it
            would work,” he said. “Just once to get supplies before the winter comes, one
            trip, we can steal a lot. They have lots of food stored away in their pantry. I
            doubt they'd even notice if some of it were disappeared. We could even get
            enough for your friend there.” The suggestion made sense. Winter was even
            harsher than the bleak autumn in the city, and if they could really work
            together, it would be stupid not to try stock up on food. There was hardly
            anything on the stalls that could be swiped or eaten easily during the cold
            months, and the farmers guarded their goods more closely than ever, as even for
them it was difficult to grow food when it became darker and colder.</p>

            <p>“What about the
Council guards?” she asked. “They'll kill us if they find us.”</p>

            <p>Or worse... she
didn't add.</p>

            <p>“We'll have to
be quick.”</p>

            <p>“Ok.”</p>

            <p>Silence.</p>

            <p>“You don't mind
stealing from them do you?”</p>

            <p>
                “Why would I?” Oria asked. Food was food and filled the belly no
matter where it came from.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn shrugged uncomfortably. “What if they're right? What if they
                have some kind of power through the Seirios? What if the Seirios is a God? What
if it actually lives?”</p>

            <p>
                Oria sneered. That's what the cultivators believed. Heber had told
                her that the Seirios system was growing in luminosity, but how could a star,
                essentially a cluster of atoms (or so Heber said), be alive? Heber had never
                mentioned the cult if he could help it either, and she didn't care either,
                unless the Seirios decided to give her a dry bed to sleep in and a warm meal.
                She thought Heber had shared that view. While he was ecstatic with the rest of
                science and discovery and useless facts, and the creation of stars sent him
                into fits of euphoria, the Seirios always made him bitter and hard. It wasn't
surprising considering his sick sister.</p>

            <p>
                “That is a myth” she said.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn said nothing.</p>

            <p>
                “When do you want to go?” she asked as he sat back down.</p>

            <p>
                “Before it gets cold” he said.</p>

            <p>
                Oria bit her lip. There was no use putting it off if they were
                indeed going to try break into the Chantry, and by the way her stomach growled
again, she thought it agreed.</p>

            <p>
                “Why don't we do it tomorrow?” she asked.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn's eyebrows arched upward in alarm.</p>

            <p>
                “Tomorrow?” he squeaked, his voice suddenly much higher, clearly not
having expected her to suggest such an early date.</p>

            <p>
                “When else do you want to go?” she said irritably. He had suggested
this after all. Did he want to back out now that they were being serious?</p>

            <p>
                “We need a plan! You don't know anything about the secret pantry.”
he said. “I – It's difficult to get inside and I don't know if I can open it.”</p>

            <p>
                “You said you can.”</p>

            <p>
                “I think I can” he said defensively. “I – I haven't tried.”</p>

            <p>
                He thought they could. He wasn't even sure of it. Was that all he
                had to offer? Was it worth taking the risk when they weren't even sure they
                would leave it successfully? Yet if there was food in there and it was more
than they could take from the pantry at a time, at least they had to try.</p>

            <p>
                Oria took a deep breath.</p>

            <p>
                “Okay” she said. “I'll stand guard and you try to open it. Tomorrow.
You just have to tell me everything you know about it and it'll work.”</p>

            <p>
                Dread flit over his features, as if he still weren't sure she could
                be trusted, and she tried to keep her expression neutral. She didn't want him
                to think she was going to steal his secret and gave it away, as that wasn't
                what she had in mind. She would work with him if he knew how to get food. It
                was best for both of them, and much easier than finding somebody else who was
daring enough to approach the Chantry with all its mad priests.</p>

            <p>
                Q looked unconvinced, but didn't argue.</p>

            <p>
                Tomorrow it was, then.</p>

            <p><i>Tomorrow</i>.</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                They spent most of the next day discussing strategy in the safety of
                their hideout, hungry because they had decided to save the black beans she had
                swiped the day before for the important night. The most important part was to
                stay concealed until they were close, which was why he offered her his cap, yet
                she cringed away from it and the thoughts of disease that came with touching
anything he had worn before.</p>

            <p>
                It stopped to rain dirt some time later that day as well, but their
                endeavour was delayed another two days when a storm of dust and dirt rolled
                through the city, in which a merchant's cart broke down just outside of their
                hideout, and Quinn managed to snatch a whole cheese and a crate of apples
                before the farmhand got the wheel fixed. Oria couldn't deny she was impressed
by his precision though he could only use one hand.</p>

            <p>
                “Where do we go from here?” she asked. “How do we get inside?”</p>

            <p>
                Oria followed Quinn up the ladder to the roof.</p>

            <p>
                “We've got to go from there,” he said quietly, though there was
                nobody else around. “You can't get inside the Chantry from below unless you
take the front entrance.”</p>

            <p>
                Quinn stood aside and held the ladder as she climbed, though it was
                perfectly stable, which made her wonder whether the older girls would find it
                romantic that he did. From the top of the building, she could see the domed
                roof of the Chantry ahead. They made their way across the tiles and stared down
into the chapel's little back yard.</p>

            <p>
                He pointed at a hatch into the back yard. “There it is,” Quinn said
                in her ear, so close he was almost on top of her, and she shifted so he wasn't.
                His presence still made her nervous. She couldn't afford getting this close to
                anyone. It was difficult enough to care for one person on this planet. “Do you
see it?”</p>

            <p>
                She followed his outstretched finger with her hand and saw a
                reinforced round trap door in the rocky ground. Her breath caught. He hadn't
                lied at all. Until the moment she had caught sight of the door she hadn't been
                sure she believed him, yet now that she saw it with her own eyes she had to.
The pantry was underground.</p>

            <p>
                “That's the secret pantry?” she asked quietly.</p>

            <p>
                He nodded. “It will take a while to open with – with one hand. You
need to stand guard and warn me when someone comes so we can hide.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria felt a pang of pity despite herself.</p>

            <p>
                “I probably wouldn't be able to with two,” she said before she could
                stop herself, and it seemed to work, because he smiled gratefully, which was
bad because it made her realize that his awful teeth had stopped to offend her.</p>

            <p>
                “How do we get down?” she asked quickly, averting her gaze, wishing
she could be more appalled than she was by his festering black canines.</p>

            <p>
                “We let ourselves down there.” He pointed at where the spiked fence
                sloped somewhat lower, which made it easy to cross from the roof, and just as
                easy to use as an exit, as there was a shallow stone wall to stand on inside
into which the metal fence had been built.</p>

            <p>
                “That looks dangerous,” she said. She was doing this to survive, but
                if she mis-stepped or slipped on the angled roof, she would be impaled by the
spike and meet a very painful end.</p>

            <p>
                “It's safe,” he said. “I've done it once already, and it wasn't too
bad. I'll help you.”</p>

            <p>
                She shrugged at that. Maybe he was right, and on top of that, being
staked had to be quicker a death than the slow crawling of starvation.</p>

            <p>
                They skirted the edge of the roof and lowered themselves down onto
                the spiked black fence once they had made sure nobody was around. Quinn held
                her wrist with his good hand while her feet searched for the gap between the
                menacing black spikes, dangling from the roof by her wrist, then she found a
                hold and he let go off her wrist, and she dropped onto the grayish meadow
below.</p>

            <p>
                She couldn't see the trap door any more though she now knew it was
                there, completely hidden by the stone wall and brushwork, and neither could she
make out anything behind the thick bulk of the Chantry.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn landed next to her a moment later, clutching his bad hand
                tightly, and she knew without asking that it hurt. Was it broken? Was he sick?
                She turned away as her chest ached. She couldn't afford to care for him as
well. It would get them both nowhere.</p>

            <p>
                “Come,” he whispered once he caught his breath, and led the way
toward the concealed door.</p>

            <p>
                Oria bent down and grabbed the handle with both her hands and tugged
                upward. It didn't move. Quinn stooped down beside her and took the other
                handhold on the opposite side, yet though she saw him straining, the trap door
                remained closed. He let out a groan of frustration and used his other hand as
                well. They yanked with all their might, but the hatch didn't budge. His eyes
                were glazed with tears of pain, which he tried to hide quickly, and his cracked
lip bit raw when they decided to stop.</p>

            <p>
                “It's no use,” he said, his diseased hand cradled in his other, as
if it, too, were in pain.</p>

            <p>
                “Do you think it's locked?” she asked.</p>

            <p>
                “It wasn't before,” Quinn said. “But they might have left it open by
mistake.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria cursed. She doubted they could get the trap door open with a
                key, as it had proven to be about as closed as the Council's collective heart.
                But Quinn knelt down onto the ground beside her and produced a small hairpin
from his shirt.</p>

            <p>
                “I'll try open it with this,” he said. He looked over his shoulder
                anxiously. “But you have to keep a lookout while I do. It takes a while to
work.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria moved over to the side entrance of the Chantry and toward the
                door in the back from where she could overlook the whole yard and around half
                the corner some of the front. If anybody came their way, she would see it
                before they were too close, giving them time to get away. That was when her
                gaze fell onto the inside wall, where a large key hung from a hook, a key
exactly the size and rusty black colour of the lock she had just left Quinn to.</p>

            <p>
                Oria almost called out in her excitement, but clasped her bony hand
                over it to stifle the sound. If she wasn't completely stupid, that was the key
                for the pantry, and it was right there, unguarded, for her to grab if only she
                pried the door open a bit and slipped inside. But that was the Chantry. Heber
                used to say that once you were an inquisitor or acolyte or oracle-doll you
                never left. Being in the Chantry's garden was bad enough, but they needed food.
                They wouldn't survive without it. And the key would make their efforts so much
                easier. They could even steal it and lock the cultists out entirely, unless of
                course they had a second key, which she thought they might, but nonetheless it
                would give them permanent access to food. It was too good an opportunity to
pass on.</p>
