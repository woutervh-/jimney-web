            <p>
                She listened into the Chantry for any noise of activity, but all she
                could hear was Quinn's continued curses and a soft metal clatter when the metal
                hairpin slipped out of his fingers, and after a moment pushed the half-open
                door with her foot. It squealed as it opened, a cold draft like those she
                associated with churches washed over her, and movement in the corner of it made
her freeze instantly.</p>

            <p>
                Movement! Inside! Her pulse jumped and she was about to run away
                when a fat cat ambled out of the Chantry and into the yard, glaring at her with
                its luminous yellow eyes, most displeased at having been roused. At the edge of
                the Chantry's yard it vanished into the bushes. Her heart was beating fast
                still. She could barely hear her own breath over it. Maybe it was a bad idea to
                go inside after all, even if it were only four or so steps until she could grab
the key and be out again.</p>

            <p>
                But she couldn't afford becoming as lazy as that stupid cat. They
                needed food for the winter, and they couldn't always use the hairpin, it took
                to long, and what if Quinn lost it? That aside, she wasn't going to stay with
                him longer than it took to swipe some provisions, and she would need sustenance
as well.</p>

            <p>
                She put several toes inside the doorway as a test, then her whole
                foot. It didn't burn or turn into stone, as the limbs of misdoers did in some
                of Heber's stories, so she felt it was safe to proceed with the other, and
                before long she stood inside the drafty corridor of the Chantry. There was
                another doorway on the opposite side, without a door, which led into the chapel
                itself, where light fell in colourful crisses and crosses over rows after rows
                of seats and a platform in the front. Oria tore her gaze away from it and took
                the key off the hook almost reverently. It was cold and heavy in her hand, but
                she was sure it was the right one, the one that would get them into the pantry.
                Or just her? What if she left now while Quinn was busy and came back later when
                he was gone? She didn't have to stay with him now that she had the key, and the
longer she did, the more likely it was she wouldn't want to leave later.</p>

            <p>
                But no.</p>

            <p>
                It was best to do this with him now as they were already inside, so
                that she could get acquainted with the Chantry's secret pantry, and then she
would leave.</p>

            <p>
                Oria turned back to the door and made her way outside quickly,
                daring hardly to believe her luck after the long wait, suddenly in a haste to
get back to Quinn and show him what she had acquired.</p>

            <p>
                “Quinn!” she hissed as she approached the hatch. “Quinn! I've got
the –“</p>

            <p>
                Her words were suddenly stifled by a rough hand.</p>

            <p>
                “What have we here?” a calmly delighted voice carried to her ears,
                together with the smell of incense and something sickly-sweet. “A little filthy
                sneaky little thief?” The voice rose uncannily in places, its erratic pitch
making her skin crawl.</p>

            <p>
                Her gaze fell on the tight cuff of his robes, which was crimson and
embroidered with black thread.</p>

            <p>
                A cultist.</p>

            <p>
                A cultist had her by the mouth and now grabbed her arms so tightly
she couldn't wind her way out.</p>

            <p>
                “Twitchy, twitchy, little bird, I'll make a songbird of you yet,”
the inquisitor rasped. “Or should I break your wings so you can't fly away?”</p>

            <p>
                Terror coiled in Oria's gut. His hand slipped from her mouth to wrap
around her neck.</p>

            <p>
                “Quinn!” she screamed, while she still could. “Quinn!”</p>

            <p>
                He didn't respond. Had he been caught as well? He had given her one
                task and she had failed to do it. She had been supposed to guard their escape
and now she was caught. Where was he?</p>

            <p>
                “Another little birdy for my net?” asked the cultist quietly, as if
he relished in her panic.</p>

            <p>
                He dragged her toward the back door she had just exited and into the
                Chantry, oblivious to her struggles, and humming softly to himself, his eyes
                bulging at arrhythmic intervals. Now that she saw his face she could make out
                the mutation scars around his eyes and beaky nose, where the disease had eaten
away the flesh.</p>

            <p>
                She kicked wildly at his shin, but the cultist was prepared or just
                didn't feel it when her foot connected with his leg. He brought her inside the
                back room and dragged her toward the main body of the chapel. He was about to
                set her down on the altar-like platform, but made the mistake of putting his
hand too close to her mouth, and she bit him hard. <i>That</i>, he noticed. He
                                                                                howled in pain and jumped away from her just as a rock came flying from the
direction of the outside corridor, and Quinn appeared in the doorway.</p>

            <p>
                “Run!” he yelled at her.</p>

            <p>
                A door burst open on the other side, spilling a whole crowd of red
                robed cultists. One of the cultists looked older, just slightly younger than
her old man, and wore the garments of a Council guard.</p>

            <p>
                Harken.</p>

            <p>
                Her blood went cold. Why was he here? What did he have to do with
                the cultists? Harken's hawkish gaze narrowed on her and after a moment his hand
went up to rub his chin.</p>

            <p>
                “The girl,” he snarled to the cultist standing to his right. “I want
the girl.”</p>

            <p>
                His chaffed and blackened hand came up to point at her as the others
                careened down the pews and toward them. Oria struggled out of the bitten
                cultist's grip and toward the door, but found it blocked by several more of the
robed men. Quinn had vanished.</p>

            <p>
                “I sense her brightness!” the High Priest who'd caught her shrieked.
                “She shines as bright as the Seirios itself! A beacon of light in the eternal
                darkness that is to consume our planet. The brightness of the Cataclysm! She
                will burn us all!” He spasmed and twitched and nearly fell to the ground on his
                knees. “The brightness! The brightness! Oh how it hurts my eyes!” He actually
                groped blindly for his eyes as she watched, as if something had burned his
eyeball.</p>

            <p>
                Her blood ran cold. Where had Quinn gone? Two cultists grabbed her
by the arms and dragged her back to Harken.</p>

            <p>
                “The Harbinger!” the High Priest now screamed. “Our shining light!”</p>

            <p>
                Harbinger? They continued to clamour the name – or was it a title? –
                while Oria screamed as well. Her mind was a frenzy of terror and shock. Did
                they mean her? A Harbinger? Of what? They continued to call her all sorts of
                names and light and portent as they carried her even as she kicked her legs and
flailed around her with her arms.</p>

            <p>
                “Quinn!” she screamed again as they lifted her onto the altar in
Harken's direct view. What were they going to do to her? She mewled.</p>

            <p>
                The leader's trembling hand vanished in his robe and reemerged with
                an ornamental knife. Oria tried to fight the panic in her head. Quinn had left
                her alone with the mad cultists and they were going to kill her. She had to do
something!</p>

            <p>
                “You have to let me go!” she yelled at the cultists.</p>

            <p>
                “Such wise words!” shrieked one of the cultists to her right. He
                raised his arms in what might have been worship and then threw himself onto the
                stone ground next to the altar with his palms on the floor and his forehead on
his fingertips.</p>

            <p>
                They were insane!</p>

            <p>
                “We must let her go!” the High Priest shrieked. He lifted his knife.</p>

            <p>
                “No!” she shrieked, her voice now as high as his. “Don't! You
can't!”</p>

            <p>
                The cultists hesitated.</p>

            <p>
                “To me,” Harken's voice cut through the noise of madness. “Bring me
the girl.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria acted. She brought her elbow up, where it connected with the
                High Priest's jaw in the moment he was distracted. She doubted he felt it,
                because there was a glazed look in his eyes and he didn't cry out although her
                elbow was only sharp bones. The others were already upon her, their jaws
                snapping at her as if they were all trying to take a bite from their struggling
quarry.</p>

            <p>
                A blur of movement flickered in the corner of her eyes and she
looked up to see Quinn charging in.</p>

            <p>
                Why he would do it was beyond Oria. He should have let her fend for
                herself at the market like all street rats had to or leave her to perish. He
                should have kicked her out into the Dirt Rain. He shouldn't have made her his
                accomplice on this quest either because they were both only rats. They had to
                fend for themselves. They couldn't rely on anyone else. But could she rely on
                Quinn? Stupid! she wanted to yell at him. Stupid! Why would he come back when
                he was safe and undiscovered? He should've run, but he was soft, and softness
would get him killed.</p>

            <p>
                “Quinn!” she screamed.</p>

            <p>
                Harken's gaze went to Quinn.</p>

            <p>
                “The boy,” he snarled. “Remove him.”</p>

            <p>
                His aide bared his teeth. “You heard the Administrator! We must
banish the corrupter!”</p>

            <p>
                Oria held her breath as they reluctantly left the altar to follow
                their leader's command. They started toward Quinn, which was like trying to a
                catch a shadow, so quickly did he move from spot to spot, and leaving her on
                the altar alone. It was Quinn's quickness and reckless bravery that got her out
of the Chantry.</p>

            <p>
                “Run!” he shouted again as he grabbed her arm and pulled her out the
back door while the noise behind them crescendoed.</p>

            <p>
                “Grab the girl!” Harken's voice boomed. “Leave the boy! The girl
must not escape!”</p>

            <p>
                Oria and Quinn raced over the meadow and toward where the spiked
                fence sloped downward. Quinn pulled himself up first then held out his hands to
                pull her up, the diseased of of which she also clung on to though he winced
                when she squeezed tight. His thin arms contracted as he heaved her skyward, the
                effort almost too much for his weakened body, and she tried to remain as still as
                she could. When she was halfway up she found a hold on the fence for her feet,
just as the cultists spilled out of the Chantry and onto the meadow.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn strained against her weight.</p>

            <p>
                “Just a bit higher!” he muttered under his breath.</p>

            <p>
                There's also Quinn's hand. She doesn't see it, but it hurts him
when she takes it.</p>

            <p>
                Tears blurred Oria's sight as she glanced over her shoulder to see
                Harken running toward her. He could kill her if he caught her – she had no
doubt of it – and all because she somehow offended his wife.</p>

            <p>
                “Girl!” Harken yelled. “Stop!”</p>

            <p>
                She scrabbled harder up the roof – nearly pulling Quinn off – and
                finally found purchase with her feet. Quinn yanked again and she slid higher,
                so she could grab the edge of the roof with one hand, letting go off his
                diseased limb, as a result of which he nearly moaned in pain, and struggled to
                scramble on the roof, but before she could Harken grabbed her ankle and yanked.
                Oria yelled out and slid back downward, Quinn still holding her other hand,
                thrown flat on the roof by the force of the pull. Her feet slid on the fence
                and her weight came back all at once to be carried by herself when Quinn let go
suddenly. Her left foot impaled itself on a spike.</p>

            <p>
                “Oria!” Quinn yelled.</p>

            <p>
                Oria shrieked in pain as the spike pierced through her foot and when
                the cultists arrived kicked at the High Priest's face with the other until with
                a satisfying crunch he let her ankle go. Quinn snatched her flailing arm
                somehow and gave a might tug that pulled her off the spike and onto the roof.
                The pain redoubled. She could barely see anything as her eyes watered and blood
                gushed from the sole of her foot. But Quinn didn't let her rest. He dragged her
upward further onto the roof and toward the ladder on the other side.</p>

            <p>
                “Move!” he yelled at her. “They're already running to leave the
                Chantry and come here!” He wrapped a thin arm around her waist and yanked her
                to her feet, which sent another cascade of pain through her foot, and began to
haul her toward the ladder.</p>

            <p>
                They crashed down the ladder more than climbed and hit the street
                with a thud, and still he insisted on continuing, his voice barely getting
through the haze of stabbing pain that jerked through her with every movement.</p>

            <p>
                “Move!” Quinn insisted.</p>

            <p>
                She didn't know how, but somehow they made it back to the
                underground in the cool light of dawn. Quinn deposited her on the straw bed and
grabbed the pot they had used to make food.</p>

            <p>
                “He saw... he saw...” she moaned as he sped back to the entrance.</p>

            <p>
                “I need to get water,” he said. “I told you my parents are doctors!”</p>

            <p>
                “The Administrator...” she whimpered.</p>

            <p>
                He vanished in the darkness.</p>

            <p>
                Oria pulled the knee of her uninjured foot up and hugged it to her
                chest. Her foot felt as it were on fire and was bleeding like a sewer fountain.
                The straw of Quinn's bed was already deep red in places and her stomach churned
                from the sickening stink of sweet iron while her lungs choked with the
                lingering smell of incense. Everything else was a haze until Quinn came back
and began to move her foot.</p>

            <p>
                “It hurts,” she moaned.</p>

            <p>
                “We have to clean it,” he insisted, tugging her hands away from
where she had been trying to hold her shoes and fend off his ministrations.</p>

            <p>
                He peeled away the soles of her ragged boots and prodded the wound
beneath gently, yet it felt to her as if were searing it with a torch.</p>

            <p>
                “It hurts!” she insisted.</p>

            <p>
                “Of course it hurts!” he responded. His face was set in
                concentration as he dipped a piece of what looked like the cleanest cloth he
could find into the heated water and brushed it over her skin.</p>

            <p>
                Oria screamed.</p>

            <p>
                “Take it away! Take it away!”</p>

            <p>
                “We have to clean the wound!” Quinn insisted, his voice panicked.
                She couldn't tell who of the two of them was in greater agony at that moment.
“If it gets infected –“</p>

            <p>
                “We need alcohol to clean it,” Quinn said, worried. “Or maybe salt?”
It sounded like a question.</p>

            <p>
                Oria was still in too much pain to care.</p>

            <p>
                “Just wrap it!” she yelled at him, trying to catch the saliva
running out out her mouth and dribbling down her chin.</p>

            <p>
                “With what?” he asked desperately, staring at the dirty rags around
them.</p>

            <p>
                “I don't know!”</p>

            <p>
                He looked at her momentarily then started to unwrap the bandage
                around his hand. It wasn't clean, but it was cleaner than the rest of the
                scraps they had left. In the short glimpse before he hid his hand again she saw
                how bad it was. The flesh had rotted away and his skin was spotty. The mutation
had formed extra humps where there should be none.</p>

            <p>
                She wanted to scream at him not to touch her, that she couldn't
                afford to get sick, but didn't have the energy to, and when he wrapped the
                bandage around her foot, she felt as if she would likely die the next day
anyway.</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                The next morning, she knew she had a fever. Her head felt hot and
                heavy, and her eyes were sticky and watered. When she looked down at her
                painful foot, her leg was streaked with blue and purple veins as well. Blood
                poison. Oria moaned in pain. Heber had always warned her what would happen if
                she wasn't careful on the streets and she had only laughed. Now, she would have
                to go and see him for medicine, admitting he had been right, though she was too
weak to even more from the straw bed to the toilet bucket on her own.</p>

            <p>
                Harken with his hawk eyes and beaky nose haunted her in her dreams.
                He wanted to have her to punish her. He wanted to hang her on the Hall of
Harvest's square.</p>

            <p>
                “It'll be fine,” Quinn said unconvincingly when he noticed she was
                lucid. She knew he was lying, of course, but her tongue was so try forming
                words was difficult and hurt. Quinn gave her water again, and she thought he
                laid down next to her on the straw bed, but she couldn't be sure which of the
blurred shadows before her vision was his.</p>

            <p>
                The day passed in a haze of pain and thirst. Quinn boiled more water
                and fed it to her in tiny sips, tilting the can to her lips so she could drink,
                then helped her up and to the toilet. He'd also bandaged her right shoulder,
                which that one cultist had bitten, during the night. She hadn't even noticed,
                and if she thought why, why he would do such a thing, it still was beyond her
                grasp. If he hadn't left her in the market, he should have left her with the
                cultists and saved his own hide instead, and, most importantly, he should leave
                her now, because she was injured and useless. She would die on her own, and
                perhaps that meant she didn't have what it took to survive. If she could not
                fend for herself on the streets of Glast, she was dead, and she couldn't, and
didn't want to, rely on anyone else.</p>

            <p>
                But Quinn was still there and even dirty and grimy as he was, Oria
                thought she fell a little bit in love. He was beautiful, even covered in dirt,
                without the fancy clothes she sometimes admired on the market. He was strong,
                stronger than she could ever be, and that wasn't because he was a boy. He was
                strong because he cared about her, and he was beautiful because he tried to keep
her alive when she should have died.</p>

            <p>
                “I've got to go out and find us some grub,” he said in the
afternoon, when she was barely awake.</p>

            <p>
                “No,” Oria moaned.</p>

            <p>
                “We're gonna starve otherwise,” Quinn insisted. He had already put
on his hat and wrapped a piece of spare cloth around his neck like a scarf.</p>

            <p>
                “What if somebody comes?” she asked. The events of the Chantry had
                plagued her with nightmares the past night, of the cultists surrounding her,
                one or several with ceremonial knives, about to slit her open from head to foot
                or drink her blood. Her shoulder still ached from where she had been bitten,
but it was nothing to the stabbing pain in her foot.</p>

            <p>
                “No one comes down here, Oria,” Quinn said, brushing her hair out of
her eyes as he did that night she had woken up cold and drenched in sweat.</p>

            <p>
                “What if someone does?” she insisted. He knew she was too shivery to
even lift and arm, and if anybody came down here she would be defenceless.</p>

            <p>
                Oria knew he would have to leave eventually or they would starve,
                but she wasn't prepared to let him go yet, telling him repeatedly to wait until
                she was strong enough to hold a knife at least. He stayed that day, and they
did their best to ignore their growling stomachs.</p>

            <p>
                At nightfall Quinn insisted on checking the wound, but Oria threatened
                him with her sharp knife if he ever came near her foot again. And yet he did it
anyway, and she didn't have the heart or strength to stab him.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn unravelled the gauze around her foot, and she knew that it was
                bad by the way his brows furrowed and his eyes darkened with worry, but he
                wouldn't tell her anything more than that, and she couldn't bring her leg up
high enough to check herself.</p>

            <p>
                Instead she let him do what he wanted – because she couldn't fight –
                and after a few hours of recovery in which she drifted in and out of sleep and
ate something he gave her though she couldn't taste it she manage to speak.</p>

            <p>
                “How was it to have parents?”</p>

            <p>
                They were lying side by side again, their gazes turned upward as if
              there were stars rather than cold steel overhead. She knew by now that he
              enjoyed telling fantastical stories, and she liked to listen though she didn't
              believe in them, at the same time breathing his scent underneath all the filth,
a blend of boy and something sweet that she liked.</p>

            <p>
                “It was good,” he said. “We had a warm house close to the Consortium
                that always smelled of herbs and medicine. Other people came when they needed
                medicine or a doctor, or when somebody was ill in their house.” He squirmed
                somewhat as he said it. “We also had my grandma live with us.” He turned to her
                with a wide smile. “My grandma was one of the oldest people around that time,
like a hundred years old.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria snorted.</p>

            <p>
                “No one can be that old,” she said.</p>

            <p>
                “They could when I was young,” Quinn said defensively, as if he
really believed it.</p>

            <p>
                Oria didn't want to be called a stupid girl again, so she moved on
quickly.</p>

            <p>
                “Was she sick too?” Oria asked, her eyes widening.</p>

            <p>
                “No, she wasn't sick, just old.” He turned away from her, directing
                his gaze upward again, and she noticed his frustration in the way he scowled.
                “I can't really remember much of it, but then when I turned five she was – she
was vanished – gone in the night. We didn't have the vaccine that time yet.”</p>

            <p>
                “Did she join the stars?”</p>

            <p>
                “Yeah,” he said. His voice quivered slightly as he made himself
                continue. “She left to join the stars, my ma said, but then she and da left
                too.” He bit his lip and turned back to face her. “Do you believe that? Do you
believe people go into the stars when they die?”</p>

            <p>
                She shrugged. Why did he always have to ask such questions? What did
it matter where they went when they died?</p>

            <p>
                “You're right,” he said. “Maybe they don't, but it's a good thought,
isn't it?”</p>

            <p>
                She shrugged again. Her skin was hot and her foot and leg burned
                from the infection. Or the medicine? Either way she didn't want to stay awake
                to listen to Quinn any more, not if he was going to ask any more stupid
questions and she was as beaten as she was.</p>

            <p>
                He must have sensed her mood, because he rolled away from her, and
                winced when his back struck the ground. He had been at the orphanage and they
                had beaten him she thought. He went to the orphanage to get her the medicine
                she needed and he suffered. She should have found that stupid, the way he cared
                too much what happened to her, yet she couldn't help feel warmed by the
                knowledge. He had risked his life just so she would live. He laughed and
                despite herself she liked how it sounded. Soft. Soft and sweet as starfruit.
The memory of the sound helped her sleep that night.</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                On the morning of the third day, Quinn was gone. Had he left her
                because he knew she was dying? She didn't know how long it would take for the
                poison in her blood to reach her heart, but if Quinn, whose parents had been
                doctors, had left, it must be very soon. It was disturbing how little the
                thought of dying bothered her in comparison to the idea that Quinn had
abandoned her. She'd thought they had become friends.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn returned some time later that night with a large amount of
                bounty in his hands, even the diseased one, which told her he had gathered as
                much as he could carry. He spilled his loot before her, and she was sure he
                didn't know she was awake, which was fine because she could watch without
                making him uneasy, and she liked that. He was thin and sickly, his hand more warped
                than it had been when they met, but to her he was beautiful and strong despite
his many flaws. Maybe it was the veil of disease that fooled her vision.</p>

            <p>
                “Oria?” he asked.</p>

            <p>
                She grunted to indicate that she was awake.</p>

            <p>
                “Where did you go?” she asked, though every word scratched her
already raw throat bloody.</p>

            <p>
                “I went to the orphanage,” he said. He grinned awkwardly and held up
                a crate filled with smaller white packages, and she noticed he winced as he
                sat. “They beat me 'cos I left, but I got them back. I stole some things we can
                use.” He rattled the crate so the white packages tumbled over each other, took
                one of them and opened it. “It's called antibiotic,” he told her. “It's for the
blood, for getting rid of the poison.”</p>

            <p>
                The white package held some pills to swallow and a bottle of
medicine, both of which he fed her with a little water.</p>

            <p>
                “What about your hand?” she asked when she saw his fingers tremble
                against the ragged blankets of the bed. She knew he didn't like the orphanage.
                She knew what they did to children there if they weren't obedient or if they
                didn't want to entertain the asteroid miners at night. Still he had gone there
                and gotten hurt because of her and now his fingers trembled more badly than
ever.</p>

            <p>
                “What about it?” he asked, but she was sure he knew what she wanted
to ask, because his gaze had followed hers to the crate of medicine.</p>

            <p>
                “The vaccine,” she pressed out.</p>

            <p>
                “They didn't have any more left,” he said with forced unconcern, and
                her heart skipped a beat. No vaccines. No way to cure his mutated hand, the
disease that was slowly spreading through and consuming his whole body.</p>

            <p>
                “You take some too,” she croaked, gesturing at the packages of
antibiotic.</p>

            <p>
                “It won't help with the hand.” Quinn shook his head. “That's meant
                to cure poison like yours only, not mutation from the Seirios. And besides you
need it more now than me.”</p>

            <p>
                She'd known that already, but she insisted on sharing the antibiotic
                nonetheless. Mutation wasn't the only disease he could catch mending her foot,
and it made her feel less frantic about his health, if only for the moment.</p>

            <p>
                “I also went to the market and got us grub,” he said when he'd
swallowed two pills himself.</p>

            <p>
                Oria nodded. Her stomach growled hungrily in spite of the poison
                cascading through her body. There wasn't a time she couldn't be hungry or
                willing to eat, even if there was a chance it would make her sick. Nobody could
afford to reject food.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn fed her the food as well, being careful to use only his good
hand, before he himself ate.</p>
