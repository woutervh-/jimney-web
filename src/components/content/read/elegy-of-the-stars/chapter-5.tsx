            <p></p>

            <p>
                Winter came in a single day and night. The temperatures dropped
                below the point of freezing, the streets became white with frost (or so Quinn
                told her), and the sewer hatch into their tiny shelter glazed over with ice
                during the night, so that Oria had to get up and help him open it. Oria
                sometimes thought of Grandpa and sometimes of Heber. Would Grandpa survive
                without her help? He and the fleabag were entirely dependent on the scarce
                mercy of others and she hadn't been able to bring him food in weeks. Would he
                be able to find enough scraps to get by? Heber, too, hadn't been visited in
                more than a month, and what if his sister had gone insane and killed him by
now? What if they'd run out of food?</p>

            <p>
                Quinn's hand, too, was getting worse daily as a result of the cold.
                What had started as a short black glove was now a complete sleeve, reaching
                almost beyond his elbow, complete with sickly black and purple pustules and
blisters, and he couldn't stop the shaking any more either.</p>

            <p>
                Still he found time to exercise with her every day, supporting her waist
                while she put more and more weight on her bad foot, a tactic that succeeded
                only halfway, as his thin limbs couldn't even hold her own weight, and more
                often than not they collapsed onto the straw bed together, where they lay next
                to each other and laughed once the pain and the hunger cramps had somewhat
                subsided. Oria could almost already walk on her own again, even if with a
                slight limp to the right side, onto which she put most of her weight, and
                though she couldn't stay on her bad foot for long yet, both of them found it
encouraging that it didn't ache all the time any more.</p>

            <p>
                “We're running low on matches,” Oria said when Quinn dressed to go
                outside the first night of proper snowfall. It was about the only useful thing
                she had been able to do with her painful leg, to sort through their stash and
determine what they needed most.</p>

            <p>
                “I'll try and find some,” Quinn said.</p>

            <p>
                Try. Of course he would try, as they always did, but something about
                his tone made her anxious. It was winter now, and every day he came back to the
                boiler room with his cheeks bright red and cracked from cold and his gloveless
                hands dry with frost. He noticed her glance at his sick arm and pulled his
                sleeve over it fully, concealing the mutation from sight. He always did that
                now, as if he were ashamed of it, or maybe because it reminded him that he
needed to be treated or he would soon end.</p>

            <p>
                It reminded her of the same thing as well. Every day she became more
                restless and worried that he wouldn't come home at some point, that something
                would happen to worsen the condition while he was out. It was a miracle that he
                had held on as long as he had in the first place, as most people who mutated
became too warped to walk within the first year and a half.</p>

            <p>
                And what if he didn't come home? What of it? she challenged herself
                and hoped to find some strength or spite to tell herself it didn't matter. But
there was nothing except more dread with these thoughts.</p>

            <p>
                What if he didn't come home? Oria would be alone again and alone
forever. Her world would turn colder than it already was.</p>

            <p>
                How stupid was she to think this way? And still she could not change
                her thoughts about Quinn in any way. She'd come to like him and enjoy his
                company. She liked the way he laughed and the way his dexterous right hand did
                things around their hideout. She liked hearing him talk and tell her stories of
giants and fairytale monsters. And worse. She relied on him.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn took his cap and left for the market.</p>

            <p>
                The sight of him going out into the cold made her remember that it
                would be time for her vaccine soon as well. She dreaded the visit to Heber more
                than she had at any other point, because this time she came with a request. Not
                because she was afraid to ask, but because she was scared of his answer. She
                couldn't be the only one to receive medicine that night, because though she had
                struggled against caring, now she didn't know any more what she would do
without Quinn.</p>

            <p>
                In the evening when he returned Quinn brought her a sweet tart.
                There were whitish pieces of fruit worked into the dough and it was covered in
a crisp layer of shimmering sugar glaze.</p>

            <p>
                “It's called apple tart,” he told her. “We used to have it at the
                orphanage.” He cringed. “When the Council visited and they wanted to make a
                good impression, they always gave us treats the days before the visit so we
wouldn't say anything about – about the rest.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria understood 'they' to be the ones in charge of the orphanage.</p>

            <p>
                She was about to take it when his hand jerked away from her fingers.
The sweet treat landed in the dirt and she looked up in surprise.</p>

            <p>
                &quot;Sorry, that wasn't - I didn't want to do that -&quot; Quinn
                stammered, his cheeks growing red so quickly as if they were being dipped in
                hot water. His hand jerked again and he tried to hide it with a sound of
                despair. She understood. The disease had a stronger grip on him now than when
                they had met. It was so bad that it impaired the movement of his whole body,
not just that one bad hand any longer.</p>

            <p>
                He turned his face away in humiliation, staring at the spoiled
                sweet, and refused to answer her question if he was well, and she knew he
                wasn't. They ate the sweet anyway, as food was food even when it was smeared
                with dirt, but it seemed to taste worse than dirt normally did, because neither
                of them could look at the other as they ate. Oria hated herself for it. Quinn
                had wanted to surprise her with the treat and the disease that controlled his
                body spoiled it. It felt to her as if the event was more meaningful than a
treat dropped onto the ground by accident.</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Oria woke early the next day, from dreams filled with ice planets
                and tropical places where plants grew in abundance, and fruit was freely
                available as it hung from the trees. These were the worlds Heber sometimes told
                her about and Quinn's ocean also featured in it. She was thirsty, but Quinn was
still asleep, and she didn't want to wake him.</p>

            <p>
                Should she try and walk the short distance to the water bucket
                herself? Her foot still ached dully, as if the white-hot fire from before had
                been replaced with glowing coal. Yet she thought she should try, because at
                some point she would have to walk and run and find her own food again, and that
                better be sooner than later, and her head was clear for the first time in a
week.</p>

            <p>
                She put her sole on the ground tentatively at first. It hurt, a
                shiver of pain searing through her foot so harshly that she had to grind her
teeth together not to yell, but nothing she couldn't handle if she had to.</p>

            <p>
                Oria put most of her weight on the good foot as she rose, clenching
                her teeth tighter as she took a shuffling step forward, then another, and
                another, until she was at the bucket and could still her thirst. Her vision had
                blurred again from the effort and her head spun as she bent and rinsed her face
                with the cold water to get rid of it. Maybe it had too been too much too soon,
                yet she was still on her feet and hadn't collapsed, though she felt as if she
were about to.</p>

            <p>
                She waited a moment until the stars had winked out, and then braced
                herself for the shuffle back to the bed. Quinn was still asleep and he looked
                exhausted. His matted hair had fallen over his eyes, and his chest and
                shoulders were thinner than they had been when they met. It must have cost him
                a lot to take care of her as well as himself, and yet again she was in his
debt, which she couldn't hope to ever repay.</p>

            <p>
                And why had he done it? Did he also like her company? Did he enjoy
                taking care of her like his parents might have? Was he then now a doctor too?
                Oria started toward the bed. He was on it and he was sweet and warm. Did he
                mind sharing his warmth with her? How weak she was to hope he liked to have her
around.</p>

            <p>
                Halfway to the bed she stumbled, lost her balance, and crashed onto
                the ground with a cry of pain as the weight of her whole body came down on her
                injured foot. Quinn was up in a second, looked around himself alertly, wildly,
and rushed over to where she lay once he saw her.</p>

            <p>
                “What are you doing?” he asked. “Why didn't you wake me?” He pulled
                her up and helped her back to the straw bed. “You're not supposed to put weight
on it yet. You could lose your foot forever if you do!”</p>

            <p>
                She wasn't sure whether that was right, but didn't respond. The pain
                in her sole and calf was excruciating, almost worse than right after her foot
                had been impaled by the spike, and it was all she could do not to whimper like
a beaten dog.</p>

            <p>
                “I have to walk some day,” she said heatedly, defensively, the pain
rolling over her in waves.</p>

            <p>
                “Not until I say you can,” Quinn said sternly.</p>

            <p>
                “I don't have to do anything you say!” she snapped, clutching her
foot.</p>

            <p>
                His nostrils flared.</p>

            <p>
                “Yes you do!” he said fiercely. “You can't even walk.”</p>

            <p>
                “I've got to get my own food!”</p>

            <p>
                “I'll take care of you until you can walk again,” Quinn said
seriously, but she didn't want to hear it.</p>

            <p>
                “I'll never be able to repay you for all you did for me!” she spat
at him, trying in vain to keep the tears of humiliation from spilling over.</p>

            <p>
                “I don't want no repayment! That's not what a doctor does! Doctors
                help people without getting anything in return if they can't pay. That's what
my parents did. That's what I do!”</p>

            <p>
                “It could be years until I walk again!” Oria yelled, tears cascading
                over her cheeks as she rocked on the spot. She didn't want to be in Quinn's
                debt forever. She wasn't used to needing help and feeling so out of control of
her own life. She wanted to be the one to take care of him if anything!</p>

            <p>
                “No it won't,” he shouted back. “If you do what I say it won't be
                years! Maybe a month or so and then you can leave me if you want to!” There
                were tears in his eyes now as well. He stared at her for a moment, while his
                words sank into her head, and, apparently realizing what he had said, he turned
on the spot and fled out of the boiler room.</p>

            <p>
                “Quinn!” she yelled. “Quinn!” She managed to get back on her feet,
                but collapsed soon after. He didn't respond to her continued calls and a short
                moment later she heard the hatch to the outside slam back onto its metal
                socket. Now she had done it. He had left her and he wasn't coming back. A howl
built in her and she let it loose.</p>

            <p>
                Why didn't he understand? She couldn't just sit here idly now that
                her head was good. She hadn't spent a day in her life useless, always doing
                something or the other, and now that she couldn't, she felt weak and dependent,
                and she hated that. She didn't want to be weak. Oria tried to get to her feet
                again, wanted to walk to the hatch and call Quinn back, but the pain was so
                overwhelming she didn't even manage the short trip to the door before her legs
                buckled and she was forced to crawl back onto the straw, where she curled up
into a ball and futilely tried to quell the tears.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn was gone.</p>

            <p>
                Was he ever going to come back? What if he was caught by the
                Administrator? What if the guards beat him bloody because he stole an extra egg
                for her? What if the cult got their hands on him, or the orphanage grabbed him
                as another toy for the asteroid miners? Her spine chilled. What if he was
already dead?</p>

            <p>
                The moment she thought it the hatch sprang open again and Oria
                jerked away, grabbing for her old knife, yet cast it away a moment later when
                Quinn stormed back into the underground, his face white as the sheets the
                cultivators used to cover their goods on the market, and his eyes wide and
scared.</p>

            <p>
                “What's wrong?” Oria asked, getting to her feet as fast as she
could.</p>

            <p>
                “I – I –“ Quinn was shaking. Was it the disease? Not yet. It couldn't
                be time yet. They still had some time left until it got so bad he couldn't
                speak. Heber's sister could still speak and it couldn't be yet, not the day
before she would go to see Heber and get them the vaccine.</p>

            <p>
                “There's priests out there!” Quinn finally pressed out, his hat
                askew and his hair crusted with icicles, still panting as if he had sprinted
                back home. “A whole load of them right in front of the market, and even more
around the Hall of Harvest.”</p>

            <p>
                “Priests?!”</p>

            <p>
                “Cultists. A whole load.” His stomach growled. His hand shook beside
his thigh. Oria couldn't watch it any more, so she turned her gaze away.</p>

            <p>
                “Show me,” she said.</p>

            <p>
                “You can't go out,” he said immediately.</p>

            <p>
                “I don't want to go out,” Oria responded. “I just want to see.”</p>

            <p>
                Quinn regarded her suspiciously, but complied. They slowly made
                their way back to the staircase, the trembling of his arm making her body
                quiver on his side, and pried open the hatch so they could see outside through
                a tiny slit without being spotted. Icy cold washed over Oria's head and
                shoulders as she peered out from the hatch, so freezing she felt her fingers
turn blue even though they were still inside the underground.</p>

            <p>
                There were indeed cultists out there, wearing black cloaks over
                their crimson robes, seemingly unaffected by the icy temperature and the cold
                wind that blew through the alleys with a sound like a wounded animal. They were
                obviously looking for something or guarding something close-by. Their heads
                turned left and right and with a shock almost as harsh as the cold she could
guess what – or rather who – they were looking for.</p>

            <p>
                Was it her? Did they still think she was their Harbinger? And what
                did that even mean? Was it like a prophet? An oracle-doll? Did they want to
                make her into another doll and call her their Harbinger of signs? The backs of
her arms crawled.</p>

            <p>
                They closed the hatch slowly, quietly, and went back to the boiler
room in silence.</p>

            <p>
                “They're looking for someone,” Quinn said as they sat.</p>

            <p>
                She didn't respond. Her neck crawled. The appearance of the cultists
                had changed their plans. Quinn wouldn't be able to go out for food as long as
                the cultists were this close to the underground and she couldn't hope to get to
                Heber's house with her bad leg quickly enough to escape their sight. On top of
                that she couldn't help wonder whether Quinn blamed her for it. After all it had
been her who'd alerted the cultists to their presence at the Chantry.</p>

            <p>
                “Do you think they know we're here?” she asked.</p>

            <p>
                “They'd have come inside if they knew,” Quinn said confidently,
though his features darkened with anxiety and his bad hand twitched.</p>

            <p>
                “Does it hurt bad?” she asked, feeling stupid, because of course it
had to hurt a lot for him to make such a face.</p>

            <p>
                “No,” he said quickly, but she knew he was lying to stop her
worrying, which she should for her own sake, yet wasn't about to ever do.</p>

            <p>
                His stomach growled again, and this time hers joined in.</p>

            <p>
                “I'm sorry I didn't stand guard as I should have,” she said quietly,
                guiltily, knowing her mistake was the reason they would be going hungry another
night.</p>

            <p>
                “It's not your fault,” Quinn said. He sounded convinced, but she
found it difficult to accept that.</p>

            <p>
                “If I had stayed on my post like I should have –“</p>

            <p>
                “Then we'd both have been caught,” Quinn said impatiently. “I
                already told you it was a stupid idea going there! I made you go there in the
first place!”</p>

            <p>
                Oria crossed her arms.</p>

            <p>
                “It's okay,” he continued. “We still have some apples and potatoes.”</p>

            <p>
                But they didn't have many matches left, and what if the cultists
                were still there tomorrow? It would get even colder soon, and without any food
to warm them, they would be dead in less than half a week.</p>

            <p>
                “I could go,” Oria said.</p>

            <p>
                “No you can't, you can't even run yet, and what if they see you?”</p>

            <p>
                “I could slip out,” she responded. “I can go out and get food and
                you don't have to move with your bad hand. I'm small and I'm fast.” At least
                she had been fast when she wasn't limping and her muscles not as weak as they
were now, after over two weeks of lying around on the straw bed.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn gazed at her foot, as if he'd had exactly the same thought,
and it irritated her.</p>

            <p>
                “I'll go tomorrow,” he said. “It won't be too bad today, we can save
some matches for the day as well.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria turned her back to him and stared at her injured foot in
                disgust. Quinn wouldn't be in this position had he convinced anybody else to
                break into the Chantry with him instead of a stupid girl like her, but still he
                had decided to stay with her. The thought made her stomach flutter with
                something that felt different to hunger, almost pleasant, though he'd probably
think it was stupid if he knew.</p>

            <p>
                But why was he still here? Would she have stayed with him if the
                Cult had decided he was their Harbinger? Would she risk her life to stay with
                him if there was a cult of mad priests following him around? She liked to think
she would have, but she wasn't sure.</p>

            <p>
                Silence.</p>

            <p>
                To Oria's great relief, Quinn returned some time later that night.
                She couldn't even express how happy she was to see him after a day spent
                worrying, trying to get back on her feet without falling, and panicking because
                she had thought he really had left. Quinn stood inside the entranceway,
                shifting his feet, almost as if the boiler room had suddenly become her home
instead of his and he wasn't sure she wanted him there.</p>

            <p>
                “I was at the market,” he said, talking to the cupboard next to her
                instead of her directly, his ears red under his cap. “I also brought some food
                to Grampa and his fleabag.” He peered at her from underneath dirty strands of
                windswept and matted light hair, a bit like a wild animal, gauging her
reaction.</p>

            <p>
                “Good,” she said. Though she was happy to see him, shame washed over
                her for her red eyes and the way she had behaved while he was gone, as if it
were the end of the world.</p>

            <p>
                “He said to tell you 'the cultists are still looking for their Harbinger',”
Quinn continued, twisting his cap in his hands.</p>

            <p>
                Her heart jolted. It was the first time either of them had mentioned
                the Cult since their narrow escape from the Chantry, and she wasn't sure
                whether she wanted to, which wasn't made easier by the news that the cultists
were still after her, their supposed Harbinger.</p>

            <p>
                She couldn't explain what had happened back there at the Chantry.
                Why that old priest though she was their Harbinger, when she was just another
filthy girl of the street, and there was nothing radiant and bright about her.</p>

            <p>
                Oria could see Quinn biting his chaffed lip, still standing in the
                doorway, as if he wanted to say something, but wasn't sure how to breach the
subject.</p>

            <p>
                “I've seen them outside too,” he said at last. “Lots of cultists, wearing
                those red robes and hats.” He hesitated. “I think they think you're some kind
                of prophet or so.” He laughed as if it were a joke, yet she could hear the
question in his voice and in the hasty look he cast at her and away again.</p>

            <p>
                “I'm not,” she responded. He glanced at her sideways, shiftily, as
                if he were suddenly scared of her. “If I was, do you think I'd be here on the
streets?” she continued impatiently. “With a gaping hole in my foot?”</p>

            <p>
                “You're not going to magic me into a rat for leaving?” he asked
                worriedly. She couldn't tell whether he was teasing her or not. Did he truly
                believe she was some sort of prophet? Did he also believe the oracle-dolls had
                magic powers? She stared into his eyes and he stared back. He didn't believe
                it, she told herself, but perhaps he did. He was often silly like that with his
stories.</p>

            <p>
                “If I were a prophet I could heal myself and magic food here
                whenever we needed it! And besides, you're already a rat,” she snapped, which
                seemed to make a lot more sense to him, because his features brightened
somewhat and his ears glowed red.</p>

            <p>
                “No, okay, I believe you,” he said. He stepped into the boiler room
                and approached her with careful steps, as if still somewhat worried she would
                pounce and devour him. In his defense, she was hungry enough she might do it.
                At that moment however she was thinking of something completely different. Had
she just said 'we' – as if there was a 'we' and not only an 'I' any more?</p>

            <p>
                They stared at each other awkwardly.
                    “Did Grampa say anything else?” she asked when the silence started to annoy
                    her. 'Grampa'. Not only was there suddenly a 'we', but at the same time had she
adopted the name he used for the old man.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn shook his head.</p>

            <p>
                “I'm sorry I left,” he said abruptly. “I shouldn't have. What you
said just made me so angry.”</p>

            <p>
                But he wasn't the one who needed to apologize. He hadn't abandoned
                his post outside the back door when they had been at the Chantry. He hadn't
                failed to warn his friends of danger, and moreover, he had saved her life yet
again that night.</p>

            <p>
                “I'm sorry too,” Oria said and Quinn's eyebrows arched upward. “If I
                hadn't left and went for the key at the Chantry, we might have swiped a sack
full of food.”</p>

            <p>
                His freckles darkened and his ears flushed.</p>

            <p>
                “Never mind that,” he mumbled, looking anywhere, but her. “It
                wouldn't have worked anyway.” He shifted on his feet and put his bad hand under
                his shirt. “I lost the pin when I tried to open the lock. It was a stupid
dangerous idea to go to the Chantry in the first place.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria swallowed. His mutated hand was giving him trouble again, and
                there was nothing they could do about it. He crossed the threshold tentatively
                and walked over to the straw bed, where she sat, her foot stretched out limply
in front of her.</p>

            <p>
                “How is your foot?” he asked.</p>

            <p>
                “It doesn't hurt much any more,” she lied. It did hurt a lot when
                she tried to get up, which had been frequent throughout the day, and now
throbbed dully from the earlier efforts.</p>

            <p>
                “I'm not much of a doctor,” Quinn said. “I just wanted to do
                something right. I wanted – I want you to get well still, but if you move it
might get worse, so I didn't know how to keep you x.”</p>

            <p>
                “You're the best doctor I know,” Oria said honestly.</p>

            <p>
                Heber, though his knowledge of medicinal plants and substances was
                great, had a no affinity against blood that made his face go white and his
                hands shake worse than Quinn's. She remembered well that one time she had cut
                herself trying to learn knife fighting for defence, and Heber had almost
fainted as he'd had to bandage it. He really was useless.</p>

            <p>
                “You're just saying that,” he mumbled, but he looked pleased as he
bent over to look at her foot. “It looks better.”</p>

            <p>
                “Did your parents always get a lot of patients?” she asked. She
                could imagine there too be many injured people in Glast with the dangers it
                posed. If she had a choice she would leave the planet, but the only way to do
so was the spaceship to Earth, and those, she would never be able to afford.</p>

            <p>
                He nodded.</p>

            <p>
                “More after the Cataclysm than before,” he said. “But people always
                came to us when they needed help, because we didn't charge them when they
                couldn't pay.” He put his arms onto his knees and his chin on his palms. “My
                mom and dad paid for the medicine and supplies from their own pocket. I always
                wanted to be like them some time, a doctor who helps everybody, even if they're
not rich and can't offer anything back.”</p>

            <p>
                He stared at the wall opposite the bed. Oria wanted to touch him,
                put a hand on his arm, but thought it might be too strange a thing to do while
                he considered the future he might never have. It was all the Seirios' fault,
                she thought. Though doctors were needed plenty all the time, now more than ever
                with all the mutation victim, there were no physician mentors left that taught
                you how to become one, and those few who had learned the craft before the
                Cataclysm preferred to make money to educating somebody else who might steal
                their patients. They were Council physicians and pharmacists. The only people
                who became doctors nowadays were those whose parents were doctors and still
                alive, or those rich cultivators' sons who could afford to pay a instructor
twice as much as he would have gotten treating patients.</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                The Cult were gone the next morning. Oria supposed it was too cold
outside now even for the cultists' long, heavy robes and cloaks.</p>

            <p>
                “I'll find us matches for sure,” Quinn said before he left. “And a
lot of food.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria watched him leave through the sewer tunnel. His left arm was
                already spasming and blue, the disease having spread further up his shoulder
                during the night. She had long debated with herself whether to tell him she was
                headed out as well or not and eventually decided to stay silent. He would have
                wanted to know where she was going or might not have let her go at all, because
her foot wasn't entirely healed yet.</p>

            <p>
                But she had to do something about his hand. She knew what happened
                to people whose mutations weren't treated. They soon joined the stars, and she
couldn't wait until it happened to Quinn.</p>

            <p>
                So she waited until he disappeared around the corner, then hopped
                back to the bed on one foot to rest her other before the long journey, and
                pulled on every piece of spare clothing she possessed. She didn't have shoes
                any more as Quinn had torn hers apart after they had fled the Chantry, but she
                had prepared sandals with leather strips to wrap around her injured foot. After
                she put them on she made her way back to the hatch and heaved until it popped
                open into the cold air then clambered out into the street. It was chilly and
                the streets slippery with ice. White flowers blossomed in front of her mouth
                when she breathed. She hadn't been outside for nearly a month, but the city had
                stayed the same in her absence, still dirty and filled with people who had just
as little or even less than Quinn and she did on every corner.</p>

            <p>
                Oria avoided the streets to the market, as she knew that would have
                been where Quinn was headed, and went east, her hood draped over her head so it
                covered most of her face and her hand clenched around the old knife in her
                pocket. She didn't know how short she walked until the first urchin asked her
                for food, but she didn't have anything to give and wouldn't have shared with
him either way.</p>

            <p>
                Heber lived on the east side of the city, in a small house that had
                belonged to his sister when she wasn't yet sick. Its rooms were full of odd and
                useless things. There was a model of the solar system and the artificial
                Seirios binary star, old physics and mathematics tomes that almost fell apart
                upon being touched, and many many clothes Heber and his sister's parents had
                sewn when they'd still had a business. The house itself was ancient and shabby,
                as anything in the city, except the Administrative Council's dwellings, and it
                surprised her every time that the door hadn't fallen apart yet, and even more
so that it held when she knocked.</p>

            <p>
                “Yes, yes,” she could hear Heber's voice haste to say. “I'm coming,
                I'm coming, no need to break down the –“ Heber had torn open the door and
                spotted her on the threshold. He was a skinny man with white hair, even though
                he was at least two decades younger than Grampa, who always wore the same light
                coloured cloth shoes and scholarly robes that made him look somewhat dusty
despite his relative youth.</p>

            <p>
                His pale blue eyes went wide at the sight of her.</p>

            <p>
                “Oria!” he exclaimed. He stared at her for a moment and Oria felt
                suddenly colder and harder than she when she travelled through the city. She
                didn't know why, but there was a glint in his eyes of something suddenly wet.
                It was gone a second later as he collected himself. “Look at you, what are you
wearing?”</p>

            <p>
                He pulled her inside the house and into the kitchen, where a fire
              of moldy wood, just like the ones they made in the underground, burned. Then he
              left to find the usual stack of clothes she could take with her. That was what
              Heber had in abundance. Well preserved, hand-tailored Clothes the poor who
              needed them couldn't afford, and the rich sneered upon for their old-fashioned
              style, a story she hadn't been able to believe for a long time, as it was
              inexplicable to her how anybody could refuse to wear an extra layer just
because its appearance was out of date.</p>

            <p>
                Oria knew better than to argue with Heber as he started to pull
                clothing after piece of clothing out of a drawer and held it to her hollow
                cheek to test its colour against her pallid skin. It wasn't really the clothes
                either of them cared about she thought. They were merely an excuse to be in
                each other's company without admitting they liked it, as close as a filthy girl
and a fallen-from-grace, equally dirt poor scholar could ever become.</p>

            <p>
                That's why she saw the pain in his bluish gray eyes the longer she
                looked. He worried about her, but he couldn't allow himself to feel to much
                because of his sick sister, and because he couldn't afford to take care of her
as well as his own family.</p>

            <p>
                He made her wash in the sink which he filled with smelly soap and
                hot water beforehand and put her into a set of pale green clothes in the end.
                The green shade of the dress brought out the colour of her eyes, he said,
                though she knew it didn't, because her eyes were dark, and the dress was washed
                out and pallid. He also found an old pair of winter boots in his attic that fit
her almost perfectly and had once belonged to his sister, he said.</p>

            <p>
                Later, when she was out of sight, safely back in her alley, or down
                in the underground with Quinn, she would rip it apart and make bandages and
cloth shoes they could use.</p>

            <p>
                She thought Heber knew.</p>

            <p>
                This time there was food. Not much of it, just what few crumbs were
                left of the last meal he and his sister had shared, but it was enough for them,
as any tiny morsel of sustenance had to be.</p>

            <p>
                “How is your sister?” Oria asked first, because she knew that Heber
                liked it when she was polite and not as stubborn as she normally behaved.
                Heber's gaze found the ceiling, where his sister usually resided upstairs, but
                the house, and he, were unusually silent.. “Did she join the stars?” she asked
quietly.</p>

            <p>
                Heber continued to look at the ceiling when he responded.</p>

            <p>
                “Yes,” he said. “Yes she did. We ran out of medicine several months
ago.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria brushed a hand over the satchel in her waistband
                self-consciously. She had saved the herbs she'd stolen that day she met Quinn
                for Heber so he could make medicine and sell it, but hadn't thought it
                important enough to get it him as soon as possible. Could she have saved his
sister if she had brought it earlier and he'd been able to use it himself?</p>

            <p>
                Heber brushed his slim fingers through his grayish white hair.</p>

            <p>
                “It has been a difficult fall,” he said quietly, not looking at her,
                as if he were scared of what he would do if he did. Or was he ashamed that he
hadn't been able to save his sister's life?</p>

            <p>
                Oria took the satchel with the herbs out of her old pouch and pushed
it over the table toward him.</p>

            <p>
                “I've got you some herbs to make medicine,” she said. “I'm sorry if
                it's too late to save Hana, but it'll get you some food from the market if you
trade.”</p>

            <p>
                Heber looked at her oddly, sadly, as if he could hardly see her in
                the dull light of the kitchen fire. He lifted a hand onto the satchel and
brushed it over the velvet of it for a moment, before he pushed it back to her.</p>

            <p>
                “You keep it,” he said in a quavery voice.</p>

            <p>
                She stared. Heber had never given back herbs she had brought, not
                like that, as if he didn't want it, because she was sure he did. He also still
                looked odd, as if he were about to cry, or say something he might regret. What
                was wrong? Was he sick as well? Was he mutating? Was he hurting somewhere she
                couldn't see? The thought pained her much more than she had believed Heber's
wellbeing could.</p>

            <p>
                But she wasn't going to force him to keep it if he didn't want it.
                Maybe she could make herb tea for Quinn later when she came back to the
                underground, and they would be warm for the night even if he hadn't managed to
swipe anything from the market to eat.</p>

            <p>
                &quot;I've to ask you something, Heber,&quot; she said.</p>

            <p>
                &quot;Yes?&quot; Heber said wearily, tiredly.</p>

            <p>
                &quot;It's nothing to do with physics,&quot; she said. His odd mood
                unsettled her, as she had never known him as anything, but the slightly
                annoying, overly enthusiastic teacher who had taken it upon himself to mentor
her in everything useless he could think of.</p>

            <p>
                He smiled somewhat at least, which she had been after, and which
made his tireed face even more lined than it already was.</p>

            <p>
                “When you're giving me the vaccine,” she said, having thought long
                and hard around how to best formulate her request. “Would you have another left
for – for a friend of mine?”</p>

            <p>
                Heber folded his hands and put his fingertips against his chin as if
he were thinking, which she thought didn't bode well.</p>

            <p>
                “You see, he's been sick for a while now,” she continued hastily.
                “His arm's mutating and the orphanage has no more supplies of the vaccine, but
I was hoping you could help us. Him. Help him..”</p>

            <p>
                Having said everything she wanted she waited. Heber didn't respond
                for such a long time her dread mounted and the taste of her fear for Quinn
                became almost tangible in her mouth. What would she do if Heber didn't have
                another syringe full of the vaccine? He was her last hope to help Quinn
overcome his sickness.</p>

            <p>
                “There's no vaccine,” Heber said at last, his eyes closed and his
folded hands bouncing against his lips, nervous, maybe even afraid.</p>

            <p>
                Her heart lurched. No vaccine for Quinn.</p>

            <p>
                “Then give him mine!” she said. Her voice was louder than she had
                intended and it carried a shred of panic she shouldn't allow herself to feel
for anybody, but herself.</p>

            <p>
                “There is no vaccine,” he repeated. He buried his face in his hands
as if he were in pain or couldn't look at her any more.</p>

            <p>
                “What do you mean 'there is no vaccine'?” she demanded. “I told you
to give him mine –“</p>

            <p>
                “No, Oria, you don't understand.” His voice sounded muffled through
                his hands. He lowered them onto the kitchen table, and she could see that his
                fingers shook as if he really had caught the radiation sickness himself. “There
                is no vaccine for either of you.” He raised one hand and ran it over his face.
                “I tried to get it for you, Oria, you have to believe me, but without anything
                to trade, and with my sister growing weaker, and then there was no more food,
                and I couldn't. I couldn't get it..” He fell silent, his eyes fixed on her
worriedly, but she was numb with shock.</p>

            <p>
                No vaccine for either of them.</p>

            <p>
                No vaccine for Quinn.</p>

            <p>
                No vaccine for her.</p>

            <p>
                She could catch any disease now if she wasn't careful. The one year
she was protected from the many illnesses of Glast was almost up.</p>

            <p>
                “Oria?” Heber asked.</p>

            <p>
                But she couldn't hear any more from him. He had been her last hope
                and he had let her, them both, down, and that was all that she could think,
whatever his reasons were.</p>

            <p>
                Oria grabbed her old clothes from the pile in front of her and jumped
                to her feet. In a moment she was in the corridor and pulled the door open,
                ignoring the stabbing pain in her bad foot and the icy draft that slapped her
                face like Heber's words had. She hobbled more than she ran out into the evening
and down the street while Heber tried to catch up with her in the doory.</p>

            <p>
                “Oria! Oria! Wait! There's something else I have to tell you – need
to ask you! We can escape this planet together! Please wait!”</p>

            <p>
                But she didn't wait and he wasn't fast enough to catch her.</p>

            <p>
                She sped away from Heber and all the things he had told her today.
                She sprinted through the alleys until she found herself back beside the ladder
                that led to the roof from which you could see the Chantry's pantry. Oria
                withdrew into a corner of the roof instead of the corner where the Chantry sat,
                and curled into a ball where she sat, her foot aching and her breath heaving
with sobs and the intensity of her flight.</p>

            <p>
                What was she going to do now? If she returned to Quinn she would
                soon be vulnerable to the mutation herself, even more so than she was out here
                on the streets, where it was only the radiation of the Seirios system and not a
                real infected person that carried the virus that came with it. But how could
                she not return to Quinn? Half an hour ago she had been willing to give up her
                own vaccine for him, and now she was too scared to go to him? That was absurd.
                Of course she would return, even if the thought of being infected filled her
with such dread she could barely breathe.</p>

            <p>
                She would be doomed if she caught the disease.</p>

            <p>
                She would be doomed anyway if they didn't find something to eat
soon.</p>

            <p>
                But most of all she would be without Quinn and she couldn't just
abandon him just because she was now just as vulnerable as he was.</p>

            <p>
                Yet it took several hours of quiet sobbing to calm her down enough
to return to the underground.</p>

            <p>
                Oria stopped right in front of the hatch, which she had been about
                to open, when she felt something tingling in the back of her neck. Something
                didn't feel right. Didn't smell right. She was sure of it. She knew when there
                was danger on the market. She knew when the Council guards were around. But
                what else could it be? She had spent most of the way back from Heber's dodging
                cultists and guards and made sure there was nobody in sight before she
approached the underground.</p>

            <p>
                A little bit closer, carefully, and she realized the hatch was
                slightly open. Her heart jolted. Quinn wouldn't have left it open. He would
have wanted to preserve heat. She pried it open some more and slipped inside.</p>

            <p>
                The air smelled of... incense.</p>

            <p>
                The cult! Had they found them? Across the small bridge at the bottom
                of the stairs she saw a man's outline against the glow of the boiler room and
                her breath halted. Cultist! Her brain screamed a warning as she approached on
toetips.</p>

            <p>
                They'd found their hideout!</p>
