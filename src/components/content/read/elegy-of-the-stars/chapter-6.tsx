            <p></p>

            <p>
                She did know a fair few vital body parts around the throat and the
                kidneys, but she couldn't have reached high enough to stab his heart from
                behind. Which meant that she had to get him down to his knees and that would
hurt.</p>

            <p>
                She braced herself and sneaked up behind the cultist while he was
                focused on Quinn, his hands twitching around the spiked club he carried. When
                she was close enough to touch the cultist, she pushed herself off the ground
                and at the man, kicking her foot as hard as she could at the spot where she
thought the backs of his knees had to be.</p>

            <p>
                Pain exploded through her injured foot, the one that impacted with
                his body, and she stifled a moan, but at least she had him hit dead on, and his
knees buckled as he fell.</p>

            <p>
                She didn't take the time to recover from the agony, but leapt again,
                this time with the knife, and slashed it down on the back of his neck, too
                weak, so that it barely grazed the skin. The cultist howled and tried to whirl
                around, trying to keep Quinn in his line of vision at the same time, which was
                his mistake. Oria pounced once more, throwing her whole body weight into the
                next hit at his chest, felt it pierce through skin, sticky wet artery, and into
                flesh. The cultist howled. Oria pulled the knife back and brought it down
                again, this time into the man's shoulder, anywhere she could reach quickly,
                again and again, until he crumbled and fell, lying there as still as a sack of
grains.</p>

            <p>
                Quickly after the adrenaline in her veins subsided and the pain in
her foot doubled with breathtaking intensity.</p>

            <p>
                “You killed him!” squeaked Quinn.</p>

            <p>
                Yes. Oria believed so as well. But on contrary to Quinn, she felt
                relieved rather than mortified at the thought. Nonetheless she couldn't claim
                it was a good feeling either, having killed a mad man, just what she had had to
do to save both of their lives.</p>

            <p>
                “He was going to kill you!” she said instead. Why was he even making
                such a fuss? She had done what was necessary. Her heart was racing in her chest
                and her palms were slick with sweat. What if he now thought she was a killer?
He wouldn't want to stay with her if she was a killer.</p>

            <p>
                He swallowed.</p>

            <p>
                “Okay, okay,” he said. “I know – I've just never seen –“ He looked
                faintly greenish. Was it really that bad? She supposed it must have looked even
                more terrible from his side of the room, when the blood had sprayed over her
                and the cultist. “Oh what will we do now?” he moaned. “This is – this is bad.
The others are going to look for him if he doesn't return to the Chantry.”</p>

            <p>
                “We could eat him like the asteroid miners would,” she suggested,
                though the thought made her slightly sick, and she was glad when Quinn's nose
wrinkled and he made a noise of disgust.</p>

            <p>
                “No way,” he said, his hand covering his mouth as if he were about
to be sick.</p>

            <p>
                “Then help me shift him,” she said impatiently, forcing herself to
grab one of his arms and pulling.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn didn't move.</p>

            <p>
                “It's no use,” he moaned, his face still white and sickly.</p>

            <p>
                “What do you mean?”</p>

            <p>
                Quinn took a deep breath.</p>

            <p>
                “If they know where we live, Oria, then we can't stay here,” he said
quietly.</p>

            <p>
                She halted in her efforts to shift the body. She hadn't thought
about that, but to her dismay it made sense, dreadfully so.</p>

            <p>
                “What do you mean?” she asked again, unwilling to believe what she
already knew to be true.</p>

            <p>
                “I mean that we have to leave here,” he said shakily. “We can't wait
like rats for the Cultists to come get us - you.”</p>

            <p>
                She didn't respond for a long moment, not until she could hear a
                clatter of tiny feet, the rats coming to investigate the smell of edible meat,
                which meant at least they wouldn't have to be worried about the body being
                found and the murder charge that came with it. It was her fault they were in
                such a situation, as she had made the mistake to get caught over a key, when he
                had needed her to stand guard, her fault that he had to leave what he had made
his home these past few years.</p>

            <p>
                She cringed away from the dead cultist when the first rat's tiny
                glinting eyes emerged from the darkness. Humans weren't the only creatures
that'd been changed by the mutations.</p>

            <p>
                “But where can we go?” she asked weakly, worried he would want to
                leave her now that they were essentially more homeless than before. “It's
                freezing out there, and I haven't prepared anything to keep the cold out of my
alley.”</p>

            <p>
                He took her hand with his good one.</p>

            <p>
                “We'll find somewhere to go,” he said, but she could feel his other
                hand shaking uncontrollably though he tried to conceal it, and couldn't help
wonder how long he would last without medicine.</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                They packed their few belongings that very night and moved out of
                the underground. Oria felt dispirited and hopeless as they exited the hatch for
                the last time and stepped into the harsh white street. Where were two street
                rats as themselves supposed to go? The orphanage was an option, she believed, but
                Quinn wouldn't want to return there. He didn't want her to experience the same
                bad things he had with the ones in charge, and refused point blank to tell her
where the orphanage was.</p>

            <p>
                And yet he kept glancing at her sideways when he thought she didn't
know.</p>

            <p>
                Did he condemn her for saving their lives?</p>

            <p>
                They squeezed inside the alley she usually slept in. Oria with her
                arms around Quinn, her head on his thin chest, where she could hear his heart
                beat, feverish with disease, but so faint it felt as if the battle with the
                disease was already lost. His breath rattled, too, like the chains of the
                scaffold in front of the Hall of Harvest, and it didn't subside from the
                journey by the time they fell asleep under the heap of scrap clothes and
carpet-shreds they'd brought with them.</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Quinn's skin was feverishly hot when they woke the next morning and
                his eyes were dull and listless. The disease had worsened over night, burning
through his veins like uncontrollable fire.</p>

            <p>
                “I don't think I can go,” he told Oria when she made to leave to
                scavenge. She didn't want to leave him there, alone in the alley, but they
needed sustenance, and, even more importantly medicine.</p>

            <p>
                But where was she going to get the vaccine? The orphanage had burned
                down and the Chantry was itself too poor to harbour these kinds of things, all
                of their priests mad with mutation. The Hall of Harvest might have medicine,
                but she would be mad to try and break in there. It wasn't just that there were
                guards, which could be fooled, but the Administrative Council kept trained dogs
as well and those wouldn't hesitate to rip her to shreds and feed on her body.</p>

            <p>
                She thought she might have risked it if it was only herself, but
                what was Quinn going to do without anybody else who cared enough to bring him
                food and medicine if she could find it? Quinn had fallen asleep when she
                emerged from her thoughts. His thin chest rose and fell with the rhythm of his
                breath on the top of her head, his arms slack around her, the diseased side
                spasming now and then. She had to do something about it or he would surely die.
                But what could she do when there were no options left? Though the last night
                she had decided against going back to Heber his condition changed every one of
                her decisions once again. They couldn't sleep in a drafty alley when he was
                already so sick he couldn't walk the short way to the market. Her pride was ill
                advised. What was much more important was to find a place they could shelter
                at, where it was warm, where she had somebody to watch over Quinn while she was
gone to find food.</p>

            <p>
                She went out wearing Quinn's cap and her worn blanket over her
                shoulders, as she had insisted he take the anorak Heber had given her the last
                time she visited to go with the pale green dress (already wadded up to use as a
                pillow). Heber might not have medicine, but now that his sister had joined the
                stars he had an empty house all to himself. He could afford to take them in and
                she could bring him edibles in exchange. She suspected Heber would even have
let them stay if they didn't have anything to trade.</p>

            <p>
                The only problem was that she was still angry about the medicine.
                Heber had let her down when she had asked him for help the last time and who
                was to say he wouldn't do it again? It had already cost her a lot of pride to
                ask about the medicine for Quinn and yet it was worth it if they could stake
out the winter with Heber and then try to find a new home come summer.</p>

            <p>
                She made it to the market without being caught by either of the mad
                cultists, where she stayed and watched for several hours first, listening in on
                people's conversations, doing this, trying to get enough information as to
                where she could find another sample of the vaccine, anything that could help
                save Quinn and herself. Yet the citizens and cultivators talked about anything,
                but that. How the cultivation was going. How the orchards on the other side of
                the planet were coming along in the cold. What crop was going to be the next
                they tried their hands on on this planet. Only once the conversation approached
                the topic of vaccines, by the mention of the orphanage, which she learned then
                had burned down a month or so ago, but only to express their disdain about the
                street rats who'd burned in the house. Oria wondered if they had children
                themselves to be able to afford speaking so ill of those who had been
unfortunate to have nothing.</p>

            <p>
                Around midday, she swiped eggs and garlic from the back of a moving
                cart, stuffed her pockets with bread and sausages on the other side of the
                market, and stole the scarf of an errand boy who carelessly disposed of it to
                scratch his sweaty neck as he worked. Then she removed the saddle of a waiting
                dragbeast, took the warm fleece blanket underneath, and scampered before the
owner could wallop her backside with his whip.</p>

            <p>
                Afterwards she went back to the alley and deposited the food and
                kissed Quinn's hot forehead before she took off for Heber's house, where she
                hesitated before the door for half an hour before the though of Quinn twisting
and turning in fitful sleep made her cross the threshold and knock.</p>

            <p>
                There was no answer.</p>

            <p>
                What was Heber doing? He didn't normally take this long to come to
the door.</p>

            <p>
                Oria knocked again after another ten minutes had passed, but the
                house stayed quiet. Had Heber gone out? But he never went out. Did he just not
want to talk to her because of their fight all those weeks ago?</p>

            <p>
                She swallowed a wad of anger and knocked again.</p>

            <p>
                “Heber! Heber open the door! It's Oria! Heber!”</p>

            <p>
                But the house stayed as quiet as a gravehill. Tears of anger and
                humiliation burned in the back of her eyes as she rounded the house, yelling
                for Heber, who didn't respond. Did he want her to beg? He hadn't ever been this
                cruel before. They'd had an unspoken deal that she could be who she wanted to
                be as long as she was polite when she talked. Had he joined the stars as well?
                But he had looked healthier than before when she saw him last. Did he hate her
                now that they had fought? Would he let her stand outside in the cold? Did he
hate her because she had asked for more vaccine than was due to her?</p>

            <p>
                “HEBER!” she pounded against the front door once more when she had
finished her round.</p>

            <p>
                The house was as silent and looked... cold.</p>

            <p>
                Oria's anger mounted. She stifled a scream and tore away from the
                house, away from Heber who didn't want to speak to her any more, away from
                Heber who had been something like a father to her, yet obviously she hadn't
                been a daughter to him after all. She had been a fool to believe that he
                actually cared. She shouldn't have come and asked him for help at all. The
                rejection only steeled her resolve not to need or accept help from anybody ever
again.</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                A few days later it began to snow, nothing like the white powder
                Heber described in his stories, but a dark grayish sleet that was the product
                of the Seirios' radiation and the cold. The temperature dropped lower than she
                could remember them ever having been and her days became a rush of visiting the
                market to steal food and banging her fists against the door of Heber's house
                despite herself. Quinn was getting worse and he couldn't afford not to try everything
                to get them a save place to stay for when the air grew as icy as it had. She
                and Grampa and the fleabag might survive the icy mid winter in the alley, but
                it was doubtful Quinn would live long enough to even see the mid winter sunrise
                if she didn't act. The nights she spent watching over Quinn and feeding him
                watery soup and old bread. In the morning she cooked herbs into a remedial
                concoction that did nothing to alleviate his hurt, but at least warmed his –
and also her – belly.</p>

            <p>
                At some point she relocated them closer to Grampa and his fleabag to
                keep an eye – or at least a pair of ears – on Quinn. It wasn't easy to feed
                three humans plus a fleabag, but it would be worse if they were on their own
                completely. Though Grampa wasn't Heber and didn't know anything about medicine
                he provided shelter and willingly took care of Quinn while she was out to swipe
                provisions. Heber on the other hand hadn't shown himself ever since he had
given her the green clothes.</p>

            <p>
                “Heber! Heber!” Another day found her again trying to break down
                Heber's front door with her bare fists, yelling until she was hoarse and tears
                of humiliation scorched the backs of her eyeballs. “Heber! I'm sorry for what I
said before! Open up! Heber!” Her voice quavered and died in the cold.</p>

            <p>
                Heber still refused to talk to her, or maybe he was afraid she had
                already caught the disease and didn't want to let her inside any more. She had
                never thought Heber could be this cruel, had always believed him to be a good
                person at heart despite his oddities, but everything about his continued
                silence showed her that she had been wrong, and she hated herself for needing
                his help, and for having become so attached to Quinn she became hysterical
every time she thought of him joining the stars.</p>

            <p>
                Her fists pounded the door and the wood creaked.</p>

            <p>
                “HEBER! OPEN UP! PLEASE!”</p>

            <p>
                “I don't think he wants you,” said a voice next to her ear, and she
                whirled around to see three men standing around her, smiling, yet there was
                something about their grins that told her they were there to block her escape
                rather than have a conversation. “That's his bad, though, isn't it?” one of
them continued. There was black dust and dirt in the wrinkles around his eyes.</p>

            <p>
                The other had a scarred face and large hands that were calloused and
rough.</p>

            <p>
                Miners.</p>

            <p>
                “Leave me alone!” she snapped. “Heber! Open up!” Her voice had gone
                higher with the last word. Who knew what those two miners would do if Heber
didn't show soon?</p>

            <p>
                The miners looked at each other, worriedly, maybe wondering whether
Heber would come out with a weapon if he did.</p>

            <p>
                The house stayed as silent as it always did these days.</p>

            <p>
                The miners relaxed somewhat. One of them put a hand on her shoulder,
                and she bit down fiercely on his fingers, but lost her cap as he lashed out in
retaliation and slapped her so she flew several paces down the alley.</p>

            <p>
                “Hell! It's a girl,” said the other.</p>

            <p>
                Oria snarled.</p>

            <p>
                “Even better, innit?” said the first with a smirk.</p>

            <p>
                She felt their gazes travel down her body and took a step back. Her
skin crawled.</p>

            <p>
                “You're going to pay for biting my hand, little rat,” her victim
roared.</p>

            <p>
                “Heber!” she yelled again.</p>

            <p>
                There was no way out of this unless Heber opened the door and let
                her inside. He wouldn't leave her out here to her fate, would he? He couldn't.
                No matter how much Heber hated her, he wouldn't want that to happen to her,
he'd told her caution every other day. He wouldn't let it happen.</p>

            <p>
                “Heber!”</p>

            <p>
                The unbitten miner laughed while the other charged at her like a
                bull. It was difficult on her still-hurting foot, but she darted aside and out
                of the way. Again the miner came at her and she flit away towards the house's
                wall. She was trapped. If the other one decided to help his companion, who knew
what was going to happen?</p>

            <p>
                On top of that, she was too hoarse to yell by now, and nobody would
answer her calls anyway, as nobody cared for the many lost street rats.</p>

            <p>
                “Hey, hold it there, little bitch!”</p>

            <p>
                She was about to fight when a dart of black and brown streaked
towards her and the two men.</p>

            <p>
                “Fleabag!” she exclaimed.</p>

            <p>
                But the miners were retreating now in disgust as the fleabag put
                itself between her and them and snarled. They thought it was infected. They may
                have been right, but Oria didn't care at this moment. As the fleabag distracted
the men she started to run in the opposite direction.</p>

            <p>
                Why had it been alone? Where was Grampa? Why had the dog left his
                master's side? Had something happened to Quinn? Oria rounded the corner to the
                sheltered alley and saw nothing of the old man, but Quinn was still curled up
                on the nest of dirty cloth and carpet. She slid down to her knees and pulled
                him toward her, under her fingers the thinness of his bones and the heat of his
fevered skin as he rocked.</p>

            <p>
                “You need to get up,” Oria said to him once she had mulled it over
                in her head. “We have to move.” They couldn't stay here just as little as they
                could go back to the underground and she didn't have time ask about Grampa at
that moment.</p>

            <p>
                “But where will we go?” he asked weakly.</p>

            <p>
                There was only one place they could go and this time she wouldn't be
turned away. She would break in the door if she had to.</p>

            <p>
                “But you said Heber didn't want us to come?” he asked when she told
him.</p>

            <p>
                “I don't care. I'll make him let us in.”</p>

            <p>
                Quinn seemed to have recovered some of his strength in the past
                night and took it on himself to carry their small satchel as they left the
                alley behind. Oria followed with as food and as many matches as she could
                manage, vowing to come back later for the rest. It took them longer than it
                would have had she been alone and her foot healthy to reach Heber's front door.
The miners were nowhere to be seen and neither was the old man's fleabag.</p>

            <p>
                Oria didn't bother to knock, but threw her cracked fists against the
wood.</p>

            <p>
                “Heber! Open up now or I'll break down the door!” she screamed into
the silence that followed after the blow.</p>

            <p>
                “Heber!”</p>

            <p>
                Heber didn't respond. She hadn't expected him to. Maybe he really
had joined the stars and nobody had come to remove his body or seal his house.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn walked past her and tried the handle. It didn't move.</p>

            <p>
                “Hold those for me for a moment,” he said and passed her the heavy
                bag. He rummaged around in his pocket, took out a new hairpin, and proceeded to
use it on the door, until it clicked quietly and swung open.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn turned back around with a wide smirk on his face that was
                highly welcome after the long time she hadn't seen it on his face, but a moment
                later he doubled over with a racking cough and she had to drop all the things
                they carried to drag him inside the door, where he collapsed just beyond the
threshold.</p>

            <p>
                It was cold inside, but not as freezing as it was on the street.</p>

            <p>
                “Heber?” she asked tentatively as she approached the steps leading
up into the bathroom.</p>

            <p>
                A howling draft from the door answered her query, but otherwise the
house stayed silent.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn used the walls on either side of him to get back to his feet
and shut the door with a snap.</p>

            <p>
                “Where is he?” he asked.</p>

            <p>
                Oria turned to look at him, standing in the corridor almost shyly,
and she wondered when the last time he had entered a real house had been.</p>

            <p>
                “I don't think he's here,” she said.</p>

            <p>
                If he had died they would have smelled it by now, she thought. The
                house was eerily empty and and several of the things that usually stood in
                certain places were missing as well. It looked as if he went away rather than
joined the stars.</p>

            <p>
                They moved through the house and into the living room, where she
                dropped their belongings and he knelt down by the fireplace to revive the
                embers Heber had left. On their way past the kitchen she'd seen a letter on it
that she ignored.</p>

            <p>
                Why would she want to know what Heber had to say to her when he'd
abandoned her as easily as a cultivator abandoned bad crops on the field?</p>

            <p>
                Instead she proceeded into the back to Heber's bedroom, where he
                stored all those crates with clothing and shoes. A thick layer of dust
                blanketed the bed and the windows, as well as the cupboards and the old
wardrobe on the opposite side of the doorway.</p>

            <p>
                “A real bed!” Quinn had joined her, his voice weak with awe.</p>

            <p>
                “You can have it,” she said. She thought she would prefer not to
                sleep this close to where she knew the man who had let her down had once slept,
and on top of that, Quinn needed rest more than she did. He was sick.</p>

            <p>
                He bit his lip.</p>

            <p>
                “Why don't we take the mattress and everything else and put them in
                front of the fire instead?” he asked. “We can sleep there together – I won't
mind – and it'll be warmer that way.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria agreed. They heaved the heavy mattress into the living room and
                then she carried down the pillows and thick wool blanket when he collapsed on
                it tiredly. He looked happier than she'd ever seen him before as he closed his
eyes and sunk into the many cushions and wool blanket.</p>

            <p>
                “You can sleep if you want,” she said. “I just want to see if I can
                get some more food tonight.” It was a long way from Heber's place to the market
                and she wanted to stock up on food before it became too cold to put a toe out.
                He didn't object, and when she left a few minutes later, he was already soundly
asleep.</p>
