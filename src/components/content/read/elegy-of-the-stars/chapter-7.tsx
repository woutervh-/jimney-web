            <p></p>

            <p>
                “I'm cold,” said Quinn the next morning, though under her touch his
                skin was white-hot. She bent over him and brought their foreheads together. His
                was burning against the chill of her exposed skin. His fever was getting worse
                the colder it became and the fire they made with Heber's old newspapers and
                ragged clothing they couldn't wear had long burnt out. On top of that she
                hadn't managed to swipe a lot the day before and they ate the last of their
                provisions during the night. The sicker Quinn became the less she liked the
                thought of leaving him behind on his own, but there was no choice about it.
                They had to eat something or they would surely die from hunger or the cold that
stole their body heat at night.</p>

            <p>
                He also needed the medicine still though she had all, but given up
trying to find it.</p>

            <p>
                What was she to do? What was she to do about Quinn and about Granpa
                and the fleabag? Quinn was sicker than before and Grandpa and the fleabag would
                be starving and might not make the winter at all. Her eyes suddenly stung with
                heat. What a stupid girl she was. Why did she think of Quinn and Grandpa and
                the fleabag when her own belly gnawed with hunger? Why did she think of others
                when it was first and foremost her survival she should be concerned with? What
                could be important than staying alive? Certainly not another street rat.
                Certainly not an old man and his ravenous-mawed pest. But her heart did not
believe it, and she cursed it for that.</p>

            <p>
                So what if she did try to break into the pharmacy? Quinn's condition
                was getting worse. He could barely stand on his own any more and when he needed
to pee she had to hold him up over Heber's toilet.</p>

            <p>
                Again she hobbled her way to the market. The stalls were almost all
                closed now to prepare going dormant. They wouldn't be open two or three weeks
                and while she was reasonably sure she could make it if only she managed to
steal enough before they did she also knew Quinn wouldn't be able to survive.</p>

            <p>
                And yet she stopped at the Hall of Harvest before the day was out.
                It was an imposing building, taller than any of the buildings around it. The
                entrance was like a beast's maw and it made her think of the fleabag shortly.
                She didn't know what had happened to it or the old man who came with it. She
                hadn't tried to find out. All her resources had to go to herself and Quinn now.
                The side of the Hall of Harvest was dome-like, but in the middle there was a
                peak where the Seirios resided. Inside, the main building was a chapel through
                which visitors could see the artificial star system and the light pipes more
                closely. The rest of the Hall was residential. The Administrative Council and
its guards lived in the dome underneath the Hall's peak.</p>

            <p>
                If she managed to break into these domes where would she look for
                medicine? Would they even have it? These people were not afraid of the
                radiation as street rats were. They could be treated. Her feet carried her, limping,
                towards the Hall of Harvest's entrance, from where she could glance inside and
                see the Seirios star-system. She might have tried to walk around the building
                and find the entrance to the residences, but a figure in the middle of the
                chapel made her halt. It was Harken. He hadn't spotted her where he knelt on
the ground before the stars.</p>

            <p>
                It wasn't only the Seirios cult that believed the man-made stars
                were something holy. The stars brought light to the city and the fields outside
                even when Glast was hidden beneath it's mother-planet Reath. It had to. Glast
                was almost always in the sun's shadow and Reath blocked the rest of the light
with its bulky body. Without Seirios the planet would die.</p>

            <p>
                Hatred surged through her for the man on the stone floor before the
stars.</p>

            <p>
                He possessed everything he wanted. He was inundated with vaccine
                shots while she and Quinn and many other street rats suffered. Her mouth
                pressed together and she fingered the old knife on her belt with her hand. She
                could kill him like she had the cultist in the underground. The priest's blood
                was still on her knife and it would be a fitting end. It was – without doubt –
                Harken who had made the cultists hurry their search. He was Glast's
                Administrator and the highest command the priests would perhaps listen to in
their mutated state.</p>

            <p>
                But she put her knife away.</p>

            <p>
                There were many guards everywhere and they find her quickly. She
                couldn't risk anyone seeing her kill the Administrator and running back to
                Heber's house. They couldn't afford to find another place to live yet again. On
                top of that her pouch was full. It'd been a successful hunt today and Quinn
would be hungry.</p>

            <p>
                But she felt like a coward. She was a coward. She thought again of
                that letter on Heber's kitchen table and saw Harken bent over the ground. She
wouldn't have had to do anything, but slash his throat from behind. And yet.</p>

            <p>
                Tears hovered in the back of her eyes as she sprinted away from the
                Hall of Harvest and the market. Coward! There was a solution to her problems
                and she didn't take it. Had Quinn made her soft? It wasn't even a question. She
                was soft. She was soft because she cared. She cared too much. She loved too
                much. How could she survive if she loved too much? How could she make sure she
                lived when Quinn was always on her mind? Her injured foot ached as she ran, but
                she ignored it. In half an hour she was back at Heber's place and opened the
door gingerly.</p>

            <p>
                The house stood there as if abandoned.</p>

            <p>
                Her chest lurched. Though she couldn't put a finger on it there was
                something off. She could smell the disease coming out of the house and the door
                was open and there was a slight draft. Had he tried to go outside? Inside there
was nothing, but darkness.</p>

            <p>
                “Quinn?” she called. Her heart ached. Where was he? “Quinn!”</p>

            <p>
                Terror trembled through her chest. She couldn't breathe. Where was
                he? Had he died? She careened into the living room with little regard to her
body bumping into the wardrobe as she braked. “Quinn?”</p>

            <p>
                The room was empty. The mattress was empty.</p>

            <p>
                Panic threatened to overtake her mind.</p>

            <p>
                “QUINN!” she screamed.</p>

            <p>
                She tore through the sheets – maybe he was underneath. Maybe he was
                hiding. She tore open every cupboard and wardrobe she could find. Her eyes
                stung with tears. “QUINN!” Her voice cracked. The package of medicine fell to
the floor as she sprinted up to the first floor and then the attic.</p>

            <p>
                He couldn't be gone.</p>

            <p>
                Not yet.</p>

            <p>
                Not today.</p>

            <p>
                He couldn't!</p>

            <p>
                She opened every cupboard and checked under Heber's dismantled bed.
                She searched the pantry and finally found him in the upstairs room curled inside
                Heber's sister's bed. It was warmer up here than below and his eyelids
fluttered weakly as she rushed inside.</p>

            <p>
                “Quinn!”</p>

            <p>
                “They came after you left,” he said.</p>

            <p>
                Her heart jolted.</p>

            <p>
                “They who? Who came?”</p>

            <p>
                “Cult.”</p>

            <p>
                It seemed to cause him effort to speak. Oria pushed aside the
                blankets he was hiding under and was about to slip into the bed with him when
he used his last effort to push her hands away. “No!”</p>

            <p>
                “No?”</p>

            <p>
                “I'm gonna see my ma and da again.”</p>

            <p>
                Her heart stopped. It didn't beat maybe two seconds or more as she
                stared at him and it took all the effort she could muster not to scream. Then
                she pushed away the blankets out of a hunch. There was blood. The cultists had
                hurt him. Her hands trembled as she put her hands on the wound to try and
staunch the flow of it.</p>

            <p>
                “Who was it?” she said. Her voice was calm and icy.</p>

            <p>
                He shrugged. “High Priest.”</p>

            <p>
                Her howl tore the air apart.</p>

            <p>
                “You don't understand,” he said. “I don't want to leave you, but I'm
                happy. I'll see ma, da, and I'll see my grandma again. Do you think she'll be
old like she was or did the stars make her younger again?”</p>

            <p>
                Oria howled again.</p>

            <p>
                Quinn coughed as he pulled himself up and took her hand in his.</p>

            <p>
                “You need to make sure you... you survive.”</p>

            <p>
                His eyes were dimming slightly and her heart pounded so heavily in
                her chest she thought her ribcage might burst. Was this it? Would he die in her
                arms? He could not. He could not! The earlier tears of frustration were now
                dry, but still her eyes hurt. Her chest hurt. Her heart beat too fast and her
                hands shook as he looked him over. Was he dying? What could she do to make him
                well again? His eyes were still on hers and suddenly guilt overwhelmed her.
                Would he be in this situation if he hadn't so exerted himself when she was ill?
                Would he be dying if she hadn't stepped on that pole and gotten her foot all
                swollen and infected? Her breath came in harsh gasps and she had to look away.
He'd sacrificed himself when he took care of her instead of himself.</p>

            <p>
                Why? Why would he do such a thing?</p>

            <p>
                “Why?” she whispered. “Why?”</p>

            <p>
                Why are you so stupid?</p>

            <p>
                “Why?” he rasped.</p>

            <p>
                “Why?” she said again. “You could have been better if you just
                kicked me out. Why didn't you do it? Why didn't you do it!” the last part came
out as a yell.</p>

            <p>
                But Quinn only smiled.</p>

            <p>
                “Why?” she demanded. And she shook him.</p>

            <p>
                “Why not?” he rasped. He coughed and tried to turn away as spittle
                sprayed her hands and arms. “Why would I leave you behind? We were in this
together. Oria and Quinn. Burning bright.”</p>

            <p>
                “You must live!”</p>

            <p>
                He shook his head. “It doesn't matter.”</p>

            <p>
                “What do you mean it doesn't matter!” she snapped. She was suddenly
furious, though she did not know why, and her eyes stung harshly with salt.</p>

            <p>
                Why cry now? she snapped at herself. He chose this! And Quinn was
still smiling tiredly at her.</p>

            <p>
                “What does it matter only to survive?” he said. “I saved you because
                – because I don't know. I just wanted to save you. I wanted you to get well.
Isn't that reason enough?”</p>

            <p>
                “But you'll die!”</p>

            <p>
                Again he shook his head. “I'm not – I'm not unhappy. I'd save you
                again if I could. I'd save you and I'd take you to Earth and to the oceans and
                the blue skies. I'd save you and when we grow up we can get married and –“ He
blushed. “- and we'd be safe. We'd be safe, Oria.”</p>

            <p>
                And she looked at him, and still she didn't understand. How could he
                have been this stupid? He was getting worse and worse and taking care of her
                before himself was at fault. Why had he done it? She wanted to shake him again,
                but his eyes were now closed, his breathing shallow, and his bad hand looked
like a red globe of pus and blood next to him on the bed.</p>

            <p>
                Why? she asked his silent form.</p>

            <p>
                Why would he do such a stupid thing?</p>

            <p></p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Spring came in a day and a night and as the frost began to thaw
                Quinn's condition worsened. He joined the stars the next day, in the early
                morning, and while she thought he wasn't sad about it, her heart froze over
like the cultivators' lakes did in the winter chill.</p>

            <p>
                She shouldn't care. She should be relieved that she could now focus
              on herself again without having to keep him alive. But when the light left his
              eyes something inside of her turned hard. Hatred nagged inside her gut. Hatred
so fierce she never experienced it before.</p>

            <p>
                She had hated... She hated Heber and the cult. She hated Harken and
                the whole of the city Administration... But this was different. While the
                hatred had felt like hot coals inside of her before it now felt cold...
                simmering and yet cold. There was no space inside her mind for anything else.
                The target of her hatred was... everyone. Harken because he had hunted her. The
                cultists because they'd taken it upon themselves to destroy all she had left.
                The marketplace cultivators. They were all to blame for Quinn's death, and they
would all pay.</p>

            <p>
                Her hatred was shortly replaced by the longing to hear his voice
just one more time.</p>

            <p>
                As the sensation of longing grew harsher in her cold chest she stood
                from the mattress and after one last kiss to his cold forehead collected
Heber's letter from the kitchen.</p>

            <p>
                In the dim glow of Seirios's light coming in from the outside she
opened Heber's letter.</p>

            <p>
                &nbsp;</p>

            <p><i>
                I'm sorry I left you behind. I'm sorry I couldn't help your friend.
                I know you well. I don't know if you can forgive me, but please try. After my
                sister's death, I saw no other way out. I could not stand the thought of being
                alone, unable to help you. I sold it all. I sold the house and I sold
everything we had.</i></p>

            <p><i>
                Please come with me.</i> <i>The last shuttle
will leave Glast during the winter sun night.</i></p>

            <p><i>
                Please come after me.</i></p>

            <p><i>
                Please.</i></p>

            <p>
                &nbsp;</p>

            <p>
                There was a spaceship-ticket enclosed with the letter. Destination:
Reath.</p>

            <p>
                &nbsp;</p>

            <p>
                Oria placed the letter neatly on Heber's kitchen table. Did she want
                to go to Reath? This planet where Quinn claimed there had been an ocean of
                water and many many islands in it called continents? She glanced at the living
                room where she'd left Quinn as tears rolled down her cheeks. Was she crying
                because Heber left her alone or because of Quinn? Was she crying because she
felt dead already or because Quinn was gone forever?</p>

            <p>
                Oria collected a sharp knife out of another drawer and left the
house.</p>
