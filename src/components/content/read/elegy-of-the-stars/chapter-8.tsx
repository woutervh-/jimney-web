            <p></p>

            <p>
                The Hall of Harvest loomed before her like a giant beast. The
                Seirios gleamed. She could see the dark windows on the first domed floor and
                the lights at the porch where the guards usually patrolled, but there were no
                guards this time around. The guards who had been patrolling lay in a blood of
                blood before the doorway to the chapel. Her heart didn't respond to the grisly
                scene and neither did her mind. It didn't matter to her how or why they had
died, and she had nothing left to lose.</p>

            <p>
                Her whole body felt numb. It had ever since Quinn left to join the
                stars. There was no joy in her and no anger and nothing, but a simmering
                hatred. It simmered in the back of her heart every second of every minute of
                every hour. It simmered and the rest of her was numb. She was nothing, but numbness
and the deep hatred in the depths of her soul.</p>

            <p>
                Oria stepped over the guards' bodies and into the shrine.</p>

            <p>
                What if she died next? It did no longer matter.</p>

            <p>
                A figure sat on the steps leading upward to the glass-shrouded altar
                on which the star sat. It was only as big as her fist and yet produced enough
                light to distri, bute all over the planet. The light went into the fields on
                the other side and lit the city with the Seirios's radiance. The lighting pipes
above glimmered with mirrored light.</p>

            <p>
                “I knew you would come,” the High Priest rasped. His hands were wet
and red in the Seirios's brilliant light.</p>

            <p>
                “You can't stop me,” she said.</p>

            <p>
                His chapped lips curled into a smile. “I know what you will do.”</p>

            <p>
                “Why did you kill the guards?”</p>

            <p>
                He shook his head. “Aaah... You are the Harbinger. This –“ He stood
                and extended his bloody hand toward the star on its perch. “This was all
pre-destined.”</p>

            <p>
                Oria raised the knife.</p>

            <p>
                He was insane.</p>

            <p>
                Would he attack her? Could she kill him too? Could she fight him?
She wanted to, to avenge Quinn, but didn't have the strength.</p>

            <p>
                She took a step toward the star.</p>

            <p>
                She would kill him if he tried to stop her.</p>

            <p>
                But it didn't come that far.</p>

            <p>
                He stepped aside as she approached. She passed him without a word
and climbed the sideways splitting stairs to the top of the altar.</p>

            <p>
                “You should hurry,” he said quietly behind her as she stared at the
star. “I cannot kill everyone who will try to stop you at once.”</p>

            <p>
                She knew he was right. She couldn't fight all those guards even with
                the High Priest's help. There would be hell to pay once the guards noticed
                their brethren weren't patrolling as they should. In no hurry, but aware time
                was running out she pried the protective glass off the artificial star with
                Heber's sharp knife. It was difficult to look at the brightness of it despite
                the flow of light away through the pipes. It was also hot. She took off her
                outer layer shirt and wrapped it around the little star, then took it from its
altar, and darkness fell in the chapel.</p>

            <p>
                It wouldn't be long until the darkness spread. The pipes would cease
                carrying light. The fields would blacken on the other side of the planet.
Darkness would fall in Glast as it had made it settle in her heart.</p>

            <p>
                Oria turned back to the entrance at a sound from the high priest.
                Her breath caught. In the entrance stood guards and Administrator Harken had
                his hands wrapped around the High Priest's thin neck. The High Priest was
                turning blue and the sound she'd heard was him choking on the breath he
                couldn't take. Her eyes found Harken again in the dim glow that remained inside
                the light pipes even after she removed the Seirios and at once she understood.
                It was his fault. It was the Administration's fault that Quinn had died. It was
                his fault because he represented all that Glast was. He had not stopped it. He
                had not done right by every insignificant street rat there was on Glast's
streets.</p>

            <p>
                And who was she? Some angel of justice like in Quinn's stories? The
                Harbinger? No. She was simply Oria. And she would fight. She would fight like
                Quinn had, and she would not let him go, and she would die, as he had, and at
last, her life would have meaning.</p>

            <p>
                Administrator Harken's guards stormed the Hall of Harvest and Oria
                dropped the stars and threw herself into the fray like one of the great cats
                Quinn once described to her, a tiger, a predator, no longer a rat, no longer
prey.</p>
