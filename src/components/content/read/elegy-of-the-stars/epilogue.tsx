                There were bodies all around her Oria realized as she woke from what
                she could not describe other than a trance. A pool of cold blood spooled around
                where she lay and when she sat up to observe the carnage it dripped down her
                arms and then her legs when she stood. The Hall of Harvest looked like an
                animal had fallen onto the people in it. They were all dead. Harken, and
                Harken's guards, and the High Priest, and other priests. Had she killed them?
                It was unlikely. It must have been the High Priest. He must have called his
flock and they'd fallen upon the guards and torn them apart.</p>

            <p>
                So many bodies.</p>

            <p>
                She was surrounded by bodies.</p>

            <p>
                Was that all of them? All of the Administration and the Cult? How
                had it happened? She could truly only speculate. Had the priests killed each
other when the guards were dead? Or had they killed themselves?</p>

            <p>
                The Hall of Harvest stank of death and it stank of blood. The
                Seirios still lay where she dropped it in her sudden rage. Strangely enough it
                hadn't been touched by the blood that ran in rivers throughout the Hall. Oria
                took a careful step toward it, and then another, and bent to pick it up. It was
                warm, and bright, but the light was chill, and the warmth it emitted could not
                compare to what she had felt when Quinn talked about fantastical beasts and
giants and witches.</p>

            <p>
                She put the stars in her pocket and left the Hall of Harvest behind.</p>

            <p>
                “Clever Harbinger...” the High Priest's voice rasped behind her as
                she exited and for a fleet moment she thought to kill him as well. But he was
                already dead. His mind was dead and his heart was dead. They had been dead for
                a while she suspected. He had nothing left and perhaps soon he would die from
                his wounds. And after all he'd helped her. And so she repaid his kindness to
                kill the guards, to kill Harken for her, with his life, if he had the strength
                to survive. For herself, she needed to do more than this, she needed to do more
                than survive, and so, she took to the streets once again, with one thing left
to do.</p>

            <p>
                &nbsp;</p>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><p>*</p></div>

                &nbsp;</p>

            <p>
                It took her many hours of night to decide what to do next. As she
                huddled together with the other street rats in the alley that had once been
                hers her thoughts whirled. She had gone back to Heber's house shortly to pick
                up the letter and the tickets and had also had the courage to look at Quinn's
                still body. He was still beautiful to her and she wished more than anything
that she could bring him back.</p>

            <p>
                If only she had been faster at recovery.</p>

            <p>
                If only she could have brought him the medicine she needed.</p>

            <p>
                All she had found on her quest has been closed doors. And why?
                Because no one cared if a street rat lived or died. But she had avenged him.
She had killed those responsible or perhaps they had killed themselves.</p>

            <p>
                What little was left to do...</p>

            <p>
                Her mind strayed to the cultivators who had looked at Quinn with
                cold eyes. The cultivators who left grains that weren't perfect on their fields
                because they did not want to pay extra credits to transport them to the other
side of Glast to feed the hungry rats in the city.</p>

            <p>
                The Seirios was hot in her pocket. It hurt her to leave the street
                rats and Grandpa and fleabag to die when she left, but what could she do about
                it? If she was to make a proper grave for Quinn he would need company. He would
                have only the company of those who tormented him, but he would reign supreme.
She would make sure of it. This was his planet now. Glast was entirely his.</p>

            <p>
                Oria put her hand in her pocket and clutched the white-hot Seirios
                tight. The planet would soon be in panic about the missing stars and the
                cultivators as much as the rats would not know what to do about it. Where was
                it? Where had the star gone? Who could have taken it with all the security
                measures around it? The High Priest hadn't bothered her again although she owed
                him much more than only the death of the guards. She should have killed him
                when she could. And yet. What point would it have made? He had done what he
                thought best, like everyone else did, and her hatred was cold. He would die
                eventually and there was no reason to soil her hands at this point. The last
                shuttle would leave today to Reath and the sun would shine through the night.
                They wouldn't notice their only source of light the rest of the year was gone
                until it was too late. And by then they would be on their way to joining the
                stars because their crops would fail and they couldn't create the medicine they
needed to survive the mutation without light.</p>

            <p>
                It had to do.</p>

            <p>
                In the morning she entered the shuttle and sat in a corner seat just
                before it took off. A terrible pain ate her heart though she tried to stay cold
                and with time would devour her hatred and leave nothing, but a scorching hole
                in her chest. A hole where Quinn might have lived. A hole where Glast might
have survived. Her eyes burned, but she did not let the tears fall.</p>

            <p>
                The shuttle took off and she listened to the captain speak. The
                Seirios glowed in her pocket and none of the cultivators were on board. They
                didn't know yet that they were dead. There would be no more ship coming to take
                them to Reath where they might survive. Not until it was too late. Her heart
                burned with terrible joy at the thought. They would die as they had killed
Quinn.</p>

            <p>
                As they sped away from the planet Oria looked back at it in the
                small window next to her seat. Glast was Quinn's tomb and her departure his
                funeral. On Reath she would live rather than survive. She might find Heber and
                tell him how much he meant to her after all. She might even learn why he'd
called her niece. And she'd live like Quinn had wanted to her to.</p>
