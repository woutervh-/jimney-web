                Over the years that I've been writing I've always sought to improve myself.
                This is a list of the resources that have helped me over the years to find my own voice and to craft a story!
                If you're serious about learning the craft of writing then this resource page is for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first video that ever helped me understand why things weren't going the way I wanted and that I re-watch (ir)regularly is this one: <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/24715531">Ira Glass on Storytelling</a>.
                I recommend this to anyone's who's stuck or not satisfied with their work.
                It's only about two minutes long but it has the power to change your view of your craft.
            </p>
            <p>Out of the hundreds of writing craft books that I've read there were some that stuck out:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Anything written by James Scott Bell as a start.
                        I wouldn't call his writing books 'in depth' or even detailed but they will give you a good overview of the simplest issues you might find with your text (such as scene/dialogue/character) and how to work on them.
                    </p>
                    <p>In particular:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plot and Structure</li>
                        <li>Write your Novel from the Middle</li>
                        <li>Revision and Self-Editing</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        John Truby's Anatomy of Story.
                        This is a bit more advanced than JSB.
                        It deals mostly with how to structure your story and how to craft unique characters that are driven by the force of their passion and/or desire.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Libbie Hawker's Take Off Your Pants!
                        This was a great resource all around.
                        It's a quick read but at the same time makes you think about your stories in depths.
                        As you can guess from the title this is more for the non-outliners of the writing craft.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Seth Godin's The Dip.
                        IMO this is a must read book not just for writers.
                        It's for anyone who is serious about pursuing a certain craft or trade.
                        This book is not specifically for writers, but because it is so valuable, and because of the inspiration and invaluable information I got from it I decided to include it in this list.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I'll probably add to this list whenever something new comes up!
                Don't hesitate to also send me an e-mail if you'd like some more detailed recommendations or advice on what to read to improve.

                There is of course much much more out there in the wide wide web and I will update this list whenever I find something truly amazing to share.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a last mention, there is Steven James's book, Story Trumps Structure, which I'm currently reading and finding very useful.
                He doesn't use formula and his craft advice can be a bit difficult to understand if you're a complete beginner.
                However, if you're in the middle, know something about writing, have been doing it for a while, this book is good to get you to unlearn all the rules you've been taught but now find stifling!
                Give it a try.
                If you don't like it, you don't have to finish it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want more of these resources just let me know!
                I have a wealth of information on shelves and can recommend something for almost every situation!
                (From writer's despair to craft advice, writing life advice to 'how do I polish my sentences'. I've been there myself, and I'm glad to help you out if I can!)
